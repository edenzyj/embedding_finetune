demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings
offer precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening of resistant varieties and
development of effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether it was inoculated on wounded
or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30 °C than 25 °C, which
is meaningful in subtropical Taiwan and areas with a similar phenology. Because no significant difference was
observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25 °C, 28 °C, and 30 °C, higher disease severity
at 30 °C could be due to reduced resistance of strawberry against anthracnose at higher temperatures53,54.

Ten μl of a spore suspension (1 × 10^6 spores/ml) was deposited on one wound site, while sterile dH₂O was deposited on the other as a control. Similarly, non-wounded leaves were inoculated in the same manner. After inoculation, the leaves were kept in a moist chamber (a plastic box with dH₂O at the bottom, with the cut end of the petiole submerged in water) at 25°C or 30°C under a 12-h/12-h photoperiod. Lesion size was measured at 7 and 14 days post-inoculation (dpi). Lesions smaller than 0.1 cm in diameter were considered unsuccessful infections. The same isolates used for the “effect of temperature on mycelial growth” test were also used for the pathogenicity assay. For one selected isolate from each Colletotrichum species, inoculations of wounded and non-wounded leaves were performed at 25°C and 30°C in three independent trials, each consisting of 12 leaflets (4 leaves from 4 seedlings) per isolate per treatment. Additionally, two representative isolates of each Colletotrichum species, selected from distinct subclades based on the multilocus phylogenetic analysis, were used for wound inoculation at 30°C. This experiment was performed in two independent trials, each consisting of 12 leaflets (4 leaves from 4 seedlings) per isolate per treatment.","How were the detached strawberry leaves inoculated in the virulence tests, and what controls were used?","What conditions were maintained during the incubation of the inoculated leaves, and how were the lesions measured?","How were the isolates selected for the virulence tests, and what was the experimental design for the inoculations?","Were the detached strawberry leaves inoculated by puncturing them with a sterile syringe needle for wounded leaves, and by applying a spore suspension and water for the control?",Did the incubation of the inoculated leaves occur in a moist chamber at 25°C or 30°C under a 12-h/12-h photoperiod?,Were the same isolates used for the “effect of temperature on mycelial growth” test also used for the pathogenicity assay?,Diversity and pathogenicity of Colletotrichum species causing strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan and description of a new.pdf

nitrogen concentration and severity of anthracnose, as in
the case of cotton (Huber & Watson, 1974). Previously,
Choi
et al
. (2000) showed that, as tissue nitrogen content
decreased, Ca and Mn contents, which have a direct role
in phenolic metabolism, increased in the strawberry. Manganese
may increase synthesis of host defence products
and thereby reduce disease incidence and/or severity
(Huber & McCay-Buis, 1993), whilst calcium has been
shown to inhibit anthracnose (caused by
C. gloeosporioides
or
C. acutatum
) in apples (Biggs, 1999) and decrease
postharvest disease development on strawberry (Cheour

et al
. (1992) also found that treatment
with CaCO
3
(3·0 kg m

) in tomato reduced fusarium
crown rot disease. Calcium may be important for resistance
against certain cell-wall-degrading enzymes produced
by fungal pathogens (Conway & Sams, 1984; Biggs
& Peterson, 1990). However, in this study, no effect was
found of calcium content on anthracnose disease in strawberry.
As manganese content is increased under low nitrogen
conditions in plants, additional work is needed to
determine whether manganese levels are related to anthracnose
development. Phosphorus supplied as phosphite was
effective at reducing phytophthora root and crown rot
on tomato and pepper plants but also suppressed plant
growth (Förster
et al
., 1998). In the study reported here,
phosphorus concentration had no influence on anthracnose
development.","Previous studies have shown correlations between nitrogen concentration and the severity of anthracnose, similar to observations in cotton (Huber & Watson, 1974). Choi et al.

however, the disease is most severe when the fungus infects the crown, causing crown rot, wilt, and death. Colletotrichum
gloeosporioides was responsible for an epidemic of anthracnose crown rot in strawberry nurseries in Arkansas and North
Carolina in the late 1970s. The anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, was first reported in 1986 on strawberry in the
United States. Since the 1980s, increased losses due to anthracnose fruit and crown rots in the United States may be related
to changes in cultivars and to widespread use of annual plasticulture production rather than the matted-row production
system. Anthracnose investigations in the United States have concentrated on its epidemiology and differences among the
three causal Colletotrichum spp. in their cultural, morphological, and molecular characteristics; their infection processes;
and their pathogenicity. Results from these studies have resulted in a better understanding of the diseases and have led to
better disease control. Strawberries grown in soils with high nitrogen levels are more susceptible to anthracnose than are
those grown in soils with lower nitrogen levels or those amended with calcium nitrate. Anthracnose is spread more rapidly
in fields that have overhead irrigation and plastic mulch than in fields where drip irrigation and straw mulch are used.
Fungicide efficacy has been determined in in-vitro, greenhouse, and field studies, and pathogen resistance to some
fungicides has been detected. Anthracnose-resistant cultivars are a major objective of most strawberry breeding programs
in the southern United States.","Abstract. Three Colletotrichum species—Colletotrichum acutatum J.H. Simmonds (teleomorph Glomerella acutata J.C. Guerber & J.C.

C. acutatum inoculum levels on strawberry
foliage may increase during flowering.","The time from infection of the strawberry by Colletotrichum spp. to the first sporulation, known as the latent period, significantly affects the rate at which anthracnose can spread within a field. This latent period is temperature-dependent, ranging from 2–3 days at 25°C to 6–17 days at 5°C (King et al., 1997). At 5 and 10°C, C. acutatum has a shorter latent period compared to C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae; however, at higher temperatures, the latent periods for all species are similar. Appressoria and secondary conidia produced by C. acutatum on symptomless foliage can be a significant source of inoculum for fruit infections (Leandro et al., 2001) and may also contribute to inoculum availability throughout the growing season (Leandro et al., 2003a). Conidial germination, appressorial production, and secondary conidiation are favored by longer wetness periods beyond the 4 hours required for secondary conidia formation. C. acutatum can survive up to 8 weeks on leaves in greenhouse studies (Leandro et al., 2003a) and up to 5 weeks on fabric (Norman and Strandberg, 1997). Additionally, more conidia form on leaves exposed to flower extracts compared to leaf extracts or water (Leandro et al., 2003b), suggesting that inoculum levels of C. acutatum on strawberry foliage may increase during flowering.",How does the latent period of Colletotrichum species affect the spread of anthracnose within a field?,"How do temperature variations impact the latent period for different Colletotrichum species, specifically C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae?","What factors contribute to the availability of inoculum throughout the growing season, particularly for Colletotrichum acutatum?",Is the latent period for anthracnose infection significantly shorter at 25°C compared to 5°C?,Does Colletotrichum acutatum produce appressoria and secondary conidia on symptomless foliage that contribute to fruit infections?,Can Colletotrichum acutatum survive for up to 8 weeks on leaves in greenhouse conditions?,Epidemiology and Pathology of Strawberry Anthracnose.pdf
79,"Rain splash is the primary means by
which Colletotrichum spp. conidia are spread
from plant to plant in the field. Madden
and Boudreau (1997) found that anthracnose
fruit rot incidence generally declined as plant
density increased and concluded that plant
density reduced the amount of rain that
penetrated the plant canopy, thus reducing
the amount of splash. Most fruit infection
occurred in a 25-cm radius of the source of
the inoculum, an infected fruit (Madden and
Wilson, 1997). Ntahimpera et al. (1999)
studied splash dispersal of the conidia of the
three Colletotrichum spp. and found that
conidia of C. fragariae dispersed over the
shortest distance and those of C. acutatum
dispersed over the longest distance. This was
probably due to the greater amount of spores
produced on infected fruit by C. acutatum.

growers must rely on chemical applications 
and cultural practices to reduce losses
due to anthracnose. Failure of fungicides
to control anthracnose epidemics may be
due to the development of fungicide resistance

For example, benomyl was shown to effectively
reduce the incidence of anthracnose
crown rot (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971)
and was used intensively by strawberry
growers for years to control anthracnose

developed resistance to it and other bendimidazole
fungicides (LaMondia, 1995;
McInnes et al., 1992a; Smith and Black,
1992, 1993), and benomyl was no longer
effective for anthracnose control in strawberry
fields. In-vitro trials have been used to
screen fungicides for their ability to control
anthracnose (LaMondia, 1993; McInnes

Black, 1991). However, the propiconazoletreated
plants were shorter with dark green

untreated plants.
","Until highly resistant cultivars become available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to mitigate losses due to anthracnose. One challenge is the development of fungicide resistance in the Colletotrichum spp. population, which can lead to the failure of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics.

However, resistance developed in the anthracnose pathogens, C. acutatum and C. fragariae, to benomyl and other benzimidazole fungicides, rendering them ineffective for anthracnose control (LaMondia, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a; Smith and Black, 1992, 1993).

Additionally, plants kept in a greenhouse at 32°C after dew chamber incubation developed more severe symptoms than those kept at 25°C. Furthermore, strawberry seedlings that were 2 to 4 weeks old after transplanting (at the first true-leaf stage) were more susceptible to C. fragariae than 14 to 18-week-old seedlings when spray-inoculated with a conidial suspension (Smith et al., 1990).","How did high temperature and high humidity conditions affect disease severity in strawberries inoculated with C. fragariae, according to Smith and Black (1987)?",What differences in symptom development were observed between strawberries incubated in a greenhouse at 32°C versus 25°C after dew chamber incubation?,At what age of strawberry seedlings was susceptibility to C. fragariae found to be higher when inoculated with a conidial suspension?,Did Smith and Black (1987) find that higher disease severity occurred in strawberries incubated at 35°C with high humidity compared to those at 25°C or 30°C?,Were strawberry seedlings kept in a greenhouse at 32°C after dew chamber incubation found to develop more severe symptoms than those kept at 25°C?,Were 2 to 4-week-old strawberry seedlings more susceptible to C. fragariae compared to 14 to 18-week-old seedlings when spray-inoculated?,Epidemiology and Pathology of Strawberry Anthracnose.pdf

is another strategy being pursued
for generating disease-resistant genotypes.

regenerated from leaf explants of six commercially
important cultivars for resistance to
a virulent isolate of C. acutatum. Somaclones
with higher levels of anthracnose resistance
were identified for all the cultivars, and the
greatest increases in disease resistance were
observed for somaclones of Chandler, Pelican,

increased 12-fold. These studies provide
evidence that in-vitro screening can be used
to evaluate strawberry germplasm for anthracnose
resistance and that somaclonal variation

91,"Gupton and Smith (1991) determined that
the estimates of dominance genetic variance
were six to 10 times higher than those for
additive genetic variance. The frequency distribution
of disease severity ratings was bimodal

heritability estimates of 0.37 and 0.26
were probably sufficient to produce gains
from recurrent selection, while gains from
selection of clonal value should be possible

heritability estimates. Gime´nez and
Ballington (2002) also found that nonadditive
effects were more important than additive
effects in the inheritance of resistance on
runners. The epistatic nature of anthracnose
resistance on runners appears to be supported

parents that result in up to 20% resistant

97,"A large number of light and electron microscopic studies describing
plant interactions with Colletotrichum species have been
published, but we have not found studies on the ultrastructure of
the C. acutatum– and C. fragariae–strawberry systems. A consideration
of the detailed natures of biotrophy, necrotrophy, and
hemibiotrophy is necessary in understanding the invasion mechanisms
of C. acutatum and C. fragariae. Biotrophy is the condition
in which the fungus maintains its host cells alive while removing
nutrients from them (9,16). Necrotrophy is the condition in which
the fungus approaches living host cells and kills them before
entering their lumina (9,12,16,28). Hemibiotrophy is a condition
in which the fungus initially enters a biotrophic phase and then
switches to a necrotrophic phase (9). The initial penetration and
invasion processes of a plant host by a fungal pathogen in the
absence of a significant plant resistant response ensure successful
colonization of host tissue and subsequent necrotrophic activities.
Bailey et al. (1) described two major invasion strategies, intracellular
hemibiotrophic invasion and subcuticular intramural invasion.
Early stages of invasion for both strategies include conidial
adhesion to the host surface, germination of conidia, production of
germ tubes, and penetration of the host cuticle via appressoria.
Subcuticular intramural pathogens grow within the cuticle and
within the cell walls of epidermal, subepidermal, and subtending
cells killing host cells prior to entering them (necrotrophic phase).
Intracellular hemibiotrophic pathogens invade living cells for a
short time, maintaining them apparently for nutritional advantage,
and then convert to a necrotrophic phase.","A large number of light and electron microscopic studies describing plant interactions with Colletotrichum species have been published, but there are no studies on the ultrastructure of the C. acutatum– and C. fragariae–strawberry systems.

134,"Fungi in the genus Colletotrichum (phylum: Ascomycota, class: Sordariomycetes) cause
pre- and post-harvest diseases in horticultural, ornamental, and fruit tree crops worldwide
(Hyde et al., 2009; Cannon et al., 2012). The genus Colletotrichum was ranked among the
top 10 fungal plant pathogens with scientific and economic importance (Dean et al., 2012).
This genus is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions as well as in temperate
and Mediterranean areas. Common hosts range from high-value crops like strawberry,
olive, apple, and grape, to staple food crops grown by subsistence farmers in developing
countries like sorghum and cassava (Pastor-Corrales and Frederiksen, 1978; Peres et al.,
2005; Sangpueak et al., 2018). Many Colletotrichum species are primarily reported as causal
agents of anthracnose, which is also known by other names, like bitter rot on apple and ripe
rot on grape (Dowling et al., 2020). In addition to causing severe
yield losses, anthracnose epidemics can reduce the quality of the
produce (Waller et al., 2002; Dowling et al., 2020). Blossom blight
and fruit rots are often the main economically damaging symptoms;
however, necrotic lesions can also appear on leaves, stems, and
twigs, leading to the deterioration of plants and a reduction in fruit
quality (Dowling et al., 2020).","Fungi in the genus Colletotrichum (phylum: Ascomycota, class: Sordariomycetes) cause pre- and post-harvest diseases in horticultural, ornamental, and fruit tree crops worldwide (Hyde et al., 2009; Cannon et al., 2012).

136,"Colletotrichum species are primarily reported as causal agents of
anthracnose, occurring on plant leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits.
The disease cycles of anthracnose on different hosts have similar
components (Peres et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2017); they are
generally polycyclic, with splash-borne asexual spores (conidia)
responsible for the initiation and spread of the epidemics. Other
Colletotrichum diseases have been described, causing crown rot of
strawberry and black dot on tomato and potato roots (Dillard and
Cobb, 1997; Dillard and Cobb, 1998; Waller et al., 2002).
Colletotrichum species can also cause post-harvest diseases,
especially on avocado, almond, and citrus fruit (Prusky, 1996;
Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013); in these cases, the
pathogens develop infection structures (appressoria) on the host,
but remain dormant inside the fruit until after harvest (i.e., during
storage, transportation, or sale of fruit), at which time symptoms
develop (Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). Several
studies reported that species within a clade show similar
colonization and infection behaviour, while the establishment of
quiescence is host- and tissue-specific (Sanders and Korsten, 2003;
Damm et al., 2012; Weir et al., 2012; Prusky et al., 2013;
Jayawardena et al., 2016; Zakaria, 2021). Species within clades
also have similar temperature requirements for mycelial growth,
conidial germination and infection, and spore production (Salotti
et al., 2022). For example, C. gloeosporioides, C. fragarie, C. gossypii,
and C. musae belonging to the gloeosporioides clade show optimum
temperature for mycelial growth, sporulation, conidial germination
and infection between 25 and 32°C (Salotti et al., 2022).","Colletotrichum species are primarily reported as causal agents of anthracnose, affecting plant leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits.

137,"Integrated pest management (IPM) against Colletotrichum spp.
includes cultural, biological, and chemical control. Cultural control
includes producing disease-free propagating materials, avoiding the
use of overhead irrigation, limiting rain splashing by mulching, and
managing weeds (Coelho et al., 2008; Saxena et al., 2016). The
removal of infected crop residues and mummified or rotten fruits is
recommended to reduce the inoculum sources and the disease
pressure in the field (Samuelian et al., 2012; Saxena et al., 2016).
For instance, the removal of crop debris removal reduced by about
30% the anthracnose severity in Ethiopian sorghum fields (Aragaw
et al., 2021). The use of resistant cultivars could be an
environmentally friendly and cost-effective way to control the
disease (Saxena et al., 2016); however, available marketable
cultivars often do not provide enough resistance to eliminate the
need for fungicides (Dowling et al., 2020). Biological control agents
(BCAs), such as Trichoderma spp. and Bacillus subtilus, have been
considered (Saxena et al., 2016; Dowling et al., 2020), but most
farmers still prefer combining cultural practices and chemical
control methods because of the variable efficacy of BCAs under
field conditions (Dowling et al., 2020). Calendar-based
application of chemicals, therefore, remains the main tool for
controlling anthracnose diseases. This leads to intensive fungicide
sprays, which may involve needless applications that are not

199,"Our model is “general” in that it has one conceptual structure
that incorporates the key epidemiological components of
anthracnose diseases. Even though Colletotrichum spp. exhibit
numerous lifestyles–which have been categorized as necrotrophic,
hemibiotrophic, latent or quiescent, and endophytic, with
hemibiotrophic being the most common (Peres et al., 2005; De
Silva et al., 2017)–all of the species have a necrotrophic stage
(Prusky et al., 2013), except for the few species that live entirely
as endophytes (e.g., some species in the gloeosporioides clade on
Salacia and Camellia; Bhagya et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2015). The
timing of the switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy depends on the
host, its growth stage, and environmental conditions (Wharton
et al., 2001; Peres et al., 2005), as well as the phylogenetic clade (De
Silva et al., 2017). For instance, graminicola and destructivum
clades have a short biotrophic period, while acutatum and
gloeosporioides clades have a quiescent lifestyle on some fruit trees
like almond and guava (De Silva et al., 2017). Our model accounts
for the common attributes of the Colletotrichum lifestyles in terms
of (i) a reproductive (asexual) stage, which occurs on the host plant
or in plant debris; (ii) infection caused by conidia; (iii) an
asymptomatic (biotrophic) stage that can be short or extended
(depending on an incubation period); (iv) a necrotrophic stage in

202,"The first simplification in the design of our model concerns the
role of sexual spores in the Colletotrichum life cycle. Sexual fruiting
bodies (perithecia) can be produced on artificial media by species in
the gloeosporioides, destructivum, and graminicola caldes (De Silva
et al., 2017). Perithecia, however, rarely occur in the field (Dowling
et al., 2020), and the asexual stage is considered the sole or main
kind of inoculum in disease development. The model therefore
focuses on the asexual stage of Colletotrichum, and asexual spores
(conidia) produced in acervuli are considered as the only inoculum
responsible for the development of anthracnose epidemics.
Exclusion of a possible (even though unlikely) ascosporic
inoculum could lead to an underestimation of the total inoculum
dose in the first phase of epidemics (the so-called lag phase; Schein,
1963), so delaying the epidemic growth (Schein, 1963) especially in
rainless periods, because ascospores are forcibly discharged from
perithecia even in the absence of rain if there is sufficient humidity
(Aylor and Anagnostakis, 1991; Manstretta and Rossi, 2016).","The first simplification in our model design concerns the role of sexual spores in the Colletotrichum life cycle. Sexual fruiting bodies (perithecia) can be produced on artificial media by species in the gloeosporioides, destructivum, and graminicola clades. However, perithecia rarely occur in the field, and the asexual stage is generally considered the primary or sole inoculum responsible for disease development. Consequently, our model focuses on the asexual stage of Colletotrichum, treating asexual spores (conidia) produced in acervuli as the only inoculum responsible for anthracnose epidemics.
Excluding a potential (though unlikely) ascosporic inoculum could lead to an underestimation of the total inoculum dose during the initial phase of epidemics, known as the lag phase.

203,"A second simplification concerns the model’s structure. The
model is based on the well-established framework designed by
Zadoks (1971), in which host sites go from healthy, to infected
with latent infection, to infected with visible lesions, to infectious,
and finally to removed (sites with sterile lesions). This structure has
been successfully applied to many pathosystems, under different
climates, and on cereals and dicotyledon crops (Djurle and Yuen,
1991; Rossi et al., 1997; Savary et al., 2015; Bove et al., 2020). This
model structure assumes that all sites have equal size, that healthy
sites have an equal probability to become diseased, and that diseased
sites are randomly distributed. For those anthracnose diseases in
which lesions enlarge, such as occurs on apple (Grammen et al.,
2019; Nita et al., 2019) and strawberry (Garrido et al., 2008), the
assumption that lesions are equal in size could lead to an
underestimation of both disease severity and the dose of
secondary conidia; a lesion expansion component (Berger et al.,
1997) could be easily integrated into the model for those cases.
Given that Colletotrichum conidia are splash-borne, with short
flight distances of splash droplets from the source, the
assumption that diseased sites are randomly distributed is likely
to be wrong, i.e., diseased sites are likely to be aggregated in space
(Madden, 1997); therefore, the assumptions that all sites have an
equal probability to become affected could result in an
overestimation of disease severity. The introduction of a diseaseaggregation
coefficient for the calculation of infection rate could
account for the spatial heterogeneity in disease distribution
(Waggoner and Rich, 1981).","A second simplification concerns the model’s structure. The model is based on the framework developed by Zadoks (1971), where host sites progress from healthy to infected with latent infection, to infected with visible lesions, to infectious, and finally to removed (sites with sterile lesions). This framework has been successfully applied to various pathosystems under different climates, and on both cereals and dicotyledon crops. It assumes that all sites are of equal size, that healthy sites have an equal probability of becoming diseased, and that diseased sites are randomly distributed.
For anthracnose diseases where lesions enlarge, such as on apple and strawberry, the assumption of equal lesion size could lead to an underestimation of both disease severity and the dose of secondary conidia. Integrating a lesion expansion component into the model could address this issue. Additionally, since Colletotrichum conidia are splash-borne with short flight distances, the assumption that diseased sites are randomly distributed may not be accurate. Diseased sites are likely to be spatially aggregated, which could result in an overestimation of disease severity. Introducing a disease-aggregation coefficient to account for spatial heterogeneity in disease distribution could improve the accuracy of infection rate calculations.","How does the model’s reliance on the Zadoks (1971) framework influence its predictions for anthracnose diseases, particularly in terms of lesion size and disease severity?",What are the potential consequences of assuming equal lesion size and random distribution of diseased sites in the model?,How might introducing a lesion expansion component and a disease-aggregation coefficient improve the model’s accuracy for predicting anthracnose diseases?,"Does the model use the Zadoks (1971) framework, which assumes equal lesion size and random distribution of diseased sites?",Could the assumption of equal lesion size lead to an underestimation of disease severity and conidial dose in the model?,Is there potential for overestimation of disease severity due to the assumption that diseased sites are randomly distributed?,Irene et al.

204,"A third simplification of model design refers to the host plant.
The model does not consider host growth and senescence, and only
uses the growth stage to determine the periods in which plants are
susceptible to infection or not. Crop growth and senescence cause
changes over time of the leaf area and, consequently, of healthy sites
(Bove et al., 2020). Our simplification could therefore lead to an
overestimation of healthy sites in the early season when the canopy
is growing, or in late season when sites become senescent, both of
which could both result in an overestimation of the disease severity.
As before, the model structure could be modified by inserting
components for host growth and senescence (Savary et al., 2015;
Bove et al., 2020). That the host can be either susceptible or not is
also a simplification in our model, because there are cases in which
fruits show various levels of susceptibility to infection, and in which
the switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy depends on physiological
and biochemical changes during the fruit ripening process (Moral
et al., 2009; Moral et al., 2012; Prusky et al., 2013; Nekoduka et al.,
2018; López-Moral et al., 2019).","A third simplification in the model design pertains to the host plant. The model does not account for host growth and senescence; it uses only the growth stage to determine periods of susceptibility to infection. However, crop growth and senescence affect leaf area and, consequently, the number of healthy sites. This simplification could lead to an overestimation of healthy sites early in the season when the canopy is expanding, or late in the season when sites become senescent, both of which could result in an overestimation of disease severity. The model structure could be improved by incorporating components for host growth and senescence.
Additionally, the model simplifies host susceptibility by categorizing it as either susceptible or not, while in reality, fruits may exhibit varying levels of susceptibility. The transition from biotrophy to necrotrophy often depends on physiological and biochemical changes during fruit ripening, which are not accounted for in this model (Moral et al., 2009; Moral et al., 2012; Prusky et al., 2013; Nekoduka et al., 2018; López-Moral et al., 2019).

dematium, destructivum, gloeosporioides, graminicola, and

the coccodes clade in the current research). Calibration was done at
the clade level because of the scarcity of information at the species
level; when there was no information for a specific clade, the model
was operated by using the parameterization of other clades. This
was the case for the effect of wetness on sporulation from primary
sources only for the acutatum clade on olive and strawberry
(Leandro et al., 2003; Moral and Trapero, 2012), and for the
seasonal availability of primary inoculum only for the acutatum
clade on olive (Moral and Trapero, 2012) only. Further studies are
needed to clarify the effect of wetness on primary inoculum
production and on the longevity of primary inoculum sources. A
lack of information was also found for the effect of wetness on
infection by the graminicola clade and the effect of temperature on
incubation and latency periods for the dematium clade. In the
validation, the model was operated by using equations from the

206,"A clade-based calibration has some limitations. For instance,
the acutatum clade, which affects strawberry, almond, olive, lupin,

strawberry fruits (King et al., 1997), 19 days on olive fruits (Moral

Because of this variability, the equations developed for such
polyphagous clades had generally lower CCC values, higher
RMSE values, and CRM values more distant from zero (Table 4).
Effects of high within-clade variability were further reflected in the
model validation results (Table 5), which showed that predictions
were better for clades that had a small number of species and hosts.
The acutatum and gloeosporioides clades, which include multiple

monophyletic clade encompassing Colletotrichum species
mainly associated with grasses (Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021),

In contrast, the graminicola clade, a well-defined monophyletic clade comprising Colletotrichum species mainly associated with grasses (Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021), achieved the highest CCC value of 0.973.",What impact did variability within the acutatum clade have on model accuracy?,How did the model's predictions differ between clades with high variability and those with fewer species and hosts?,Which clade achieved the highest overall CCC value and why might that be?,Did the acutatum clade show significant variability in incubation and latency periods depending on the host?,Were predictions more accurate for clades with fewer species and hosts compared to polyphagous clades?,Did the graminicola clade achieve the highest CCC value among the clades?,Irene et al. (2023) Development of a model for Colletotrichum diseases with calibration for phylogenetic clades on diff.pdf
207,"Clade-based calibration may also have advantages. Anthracnose
diseases have often been attributed to several Colletotrichum species
belonging to the same clade, depending on the region. For instance,
the main causal agents of olive anthracnose are in the acutatum
clade, with C. godetiae dominant in Spain, Italy, Greece, and
Tunisia; with C. nymphaeae dominant in Portugal; and with C.
fioriniae dominant in California (Moral et al., 2021). In addition,
proper identification of the Colletotrichum species requires
molecular analysis of multiple DNA regions (Damm et al., 2009;
Damm et al., 2012; Weir et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2013; Damm
et al., 2014). Because the species belonging to the same clade show
similar environmental requirements (Salotti et al., 2022), a cladebased
calibration may be useful to overcome knowledge gaps for
single Colletotrichum species, to favor practical model usage when
the identification of species is not possible because of capacity or
economic limitations, and to make predictions for a wide range of
hosts and climatic conditions.","Clade-based calibration offers several advantages. Many anthracnose diseases are attributed to various Colletotrichum species within the same clade, depending on the region. For example, in olive anthracnose, the acutatum clade includes C. godetiae, which is dominant in Spain, Italy, Greece, and Tunisia; C. nymphaeae in Portugal; and C. fioriniae in California (Moral et al., 2021). Molecular identification of Colletotrichum species requires analyzing multiple DNA regions (Damm et al., 2009; Damm et al., 2012; Weir et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2013; Damm et al., 2014). Since species within the same clade share similar environmental requirements (Salotti et al., 2022), clade-based calibration can help address knowledge gaps for individual species, facilitate practical model usage when species identification is challenging or economically unfeasible, and enable predictions across a wide range of hosts and climatic conditions.",How does clade-based calibration help in managing anthracnose diseases caused by various Colletotrichum species?,Why is molecular identification of Colletotrichum species often challenging and resource-intensive?,What are some regional variations in the species of the acutatum clade responsible for olive anthracnose?,Does clade-based calibration aid in predicting disease outbreaks across different climatic conditions?,Is molecular identification of Colletotrichum species required to analyze multiple DNA regions?,Can clade-based calibration be used when species identification is economically unfeasible?,Irene et al.

208,"Given that the model was validated against independent data
(i.e., data not used in model development) and provided accurate
and robust predictions of anthracnose epidemics, we conclude that
our assumptions and simplifications did not greatly reduce the
model’s ability to make correct predictions. Overall, high
concordance was shown between model predictions and reality
(CCC = 0.928), with few errors (RMSE = 0.044), and a slight
tendency of the model toward overestimation (CRM = –0.052).
Unfortunately, data enabling model validation were available for
only five of the eight clades for which the model was parameterized
(i.e., acutatum, dematium, gloeosporioides, graminicola, and
orbiculare clades). Except for the acutatum clade, which was
validated on strawberry and olive, each clade was validated on
only one host. More complete validation is needed for different
clades and hosts.","The model's validation against independent data demonstrates its accuracy and robustness in predicting anthracnose epidemics.

209,"In our model validation, the k dose of primary conidia that can
develop from overwintering inoculum sources (crop debris, mummies,
and dormant buds) was estimated empirically from disease data; this
estimation may not greatly affect the reliability of the model to predict
disease progress because it modulates the final value of the disease
severity but not its progress. The real value of k in a field may depend
on many difficult-to-estimate factors, including the incidence and
severity of affected crops in the previous season and the proportion
of diseased tissues that remains in the field as an overwintering
inoculum source. Inappropriate estimation of k may result in underor
overestimation of infection risk during the season. Further studies
are therefore needed to improve the estimation of the abundance of
primary inoculum sources at the beginning of the cropping season.","The model's validation involved empirically estimating the k dose of primary conidia from overwintering inoculum sources (e.g., crop debris, mummies, dormant buds). While this estimation mainly influences the final disease severity rather than its progression, it may affect the accuracy of infection risk predictions.

type specimen of which was collected from Citrus in Italy. Much
of the early literature used this name to refer to fungi associated
with various diseases of Citrus, with other species established for
morphologically similar fungi from other hosts. However, several
early papers discussed the morphological similarity between many
of the Colletotrichum spp. that had been described on the basis of
host preference, and used inoculation tests to question whether or
not the species were distinct. Some of these papers investigated
in culture the link between the various Colletotrichum species and
their sexual Glomerella state (e.g. Shear & Wood 1907, Ocfemia
& Agati 1925). Authors such as Shear & Wood (1907, 1913) and
Small (1926) concluded that many of the species described on the
basis of host preference were in fact the same, rejecting apparent
differences in host preference as a basis for taxonomic segregation.
Small (1926) concluded that the names Glomerella cingulata and
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides should be used for the sexual and
asexual morphs, respectively, of the many Colletotrichum spp.
they regarded as conspecific. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides
was stated to be the earliest name with a proven link to what they
regarded as a biologically diverse G. cingulata. The studies of
von Arx & Müller (1954) and von Arx (1957, 1970) taxonomically
formalised this concept.","The name Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was first proposed by Penzig (1882), based on Vermicularia gloeosporioides, with the type specimen collected from Citrus in Italy.

219,"The “von Arxian” taxonomic concept for Colletotrichum
saw large numbers of species synonymised with the names C.
graminicola (for grass-inhabiting species) and C. gloeosporioides
(for non-grass inhabiting species with straight conidia). The
genetic and biological diversity encompassed by these names
was so broad that they became of little practical use to plant
pathologists, conveying no information about pathogenicity, host
range, or other attributes. The von Arx & Müller (1954) and von
Arx (1957) studies were not based on direct examination of type
material of all species and some of the synonymy proposed
in these papers has subsequently been found to be incorrect.
Examples include the segregation of C. acutatum (Simmonds
1965) and C. boninense (Moriwaki et al. 2003) from C.
gloeosporioides sensu von Arx (1957). Other studies published
elsewhere in this volume (Damm et al. 2012a, b) show that
several species regarded as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides
by von Arx (1957) are members of the C. acutatum complex
(e.g. C. godetiae, Gloeosporium limetticola, G. lycopersici, and
G. phormii) or the C. boninense complex (e.g. C. dracaenae).
Recent molecular studies have resulted in a much better
understanding of phylogenetic relationships amongst the
grass-inhabiting species of the C. graminicola group and the
development of a more useful taxonomy for this group of fungi
(e.g. Hsiang & Goodwin 2001, Du et al. 2005, and Crouch et
al. 2006). This group is now recognised as comprising several
host-specialised, genetically well characterised species, but a
modern taxonomy for C. gloeosporioides has yet to be resolved.","The “von Arxian” taxonomic concept for Colletotrichum led to the synonymization of many species under the names C. graminicola (for grass-inhabiting species) and C. gloeosporioides (for non-grass-inhabiting species with straight conidia).

220,"Von Arx (1970) and Sutton (1980) distinguished the C.
gloeosporioides group using conidial shape and size. A few apparently
host-specialised, C. gloeosporioides-like taxa were retained by these
authors, but the basis of their identification was often difficult to
understand. Prior to the availability of DNA sequence data, taxonomic
concepts within Colletotrichum were based on features such as host
species, substrate, conidial size and shape, shape of appressoria,
growth rate in culture, colour of cultures, presence or absence of
setae, whether or not the teleomorph develops, etc. Some studies
have found characters such as these useful for distinguishing
groups within C. gloeosporioides (e.g. Higgins 1926, Gorter 1956,
Hindorf 1973, and Johnston & Jones 1997). However, problems
arise because many of these morphological features change under
different conditions of growth (dependent upon growth media,
temperature, light regime, etc.), or can be lost or change with repeated
subculturing. Host preference is poorly controlled — even good, welldefined
pathogens causing a specific disease can be isolated by
chance from other substrates (e.g. Johnston 2000). Colletotrichum
conidia will germinate on most surfaces, form an appressorium,
remain attached to that surface as a viable propagule or perhaps as
a minor, endophytic or latent infection, and grow out from there into
senescing plant tissue or onto agar plates if given the opportunity.
In addition, the same disease can be caused by genetically distinct
sets of isolates, the shared pathogenicity presumably independently
evolved, e.g. the bitter rot disease of apple is caused by members
of both the C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides species complexes

slippage error from sequencing. The reverse primer GSR2 was

240,"Several species-trees analyses were conducted using BEAST
v. 1.7.1 (Drummond et al. 2012). Species-trees combine multi-gene
and multiple isolate data to reconstruct the evolutionary history
of hypothesised species, rather than individual isolates. BEAST
does not use concatenation, but rather co-estimates the individual
gene trees embedded inside the summary species tree. It also
estimates the time since each species shared a common ancestor
(divergence times). For these analyses the species tree ancestral
reconstruction option was selected (Heled & Drummond 2010), the
gene data partitioned as for BI and the substitution model for each
gene was selected based on the models selected using jModelTest.
The individual isolates were grouped into sets of species by setting
species names as trait values. A strict clock was used for the
GAPDH gene (as an all intronic sequence it was assumed to be
accumulating mutations at a steady rate) and the other gene clock
rates were estimated relative to GAPDH, using an uncorrelated
lognormal relaxed clock. The species tree prior used for all genes
was the Yule process, with the ploidy type set to nuclear autosomal.
Uninformative priors were used for all parameters, and were
allowed to auto optimise.","Several species-tree analyses were conducted using BEAST v. 1.7.1.

For instance, in New Zealand, C. alienum is commonly associated with cultivated fruits, while species such as C. siamense and C. fructicola, which are common on similar fruits elsewhere, have not been reported in New Zealand.","Which species are mentioned as being host-specialized, and what is their characteristic?","What types of species tend to have broad host and geographic ranges, and can you name a few examples?",How does the distribution of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu stricto vary in relation to its host plants?,Are some species of Colletotrichum considered host-specialized?,Is Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu stricto frequently isolated from Citrus?,Have species like C. siamense and C. fructicola been reported in New Zealand?,The Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex.pdf

Notes: Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. aeschynomenes”
has been used to refer to isolates pathogenic to Aeschynomene
virginica, later developed as the weed biocontrol agent Collego
(references in Ditmore et al. 2008). It has also been reported from
a range of other hosts (TeBeest 1988). Our analyses, based on a
single, authentic strain of C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. aeschynomenes”
(TeBeest 3.1.3, apparently the source of the single spore isolate
originally used in the development of Collego, Ditmore et al. (2008))
show it to be genetically distinct within the Musae clade of the C.
gloeosporioides complex. Genetically close to the geographically
and biologically diverse C. siamense, it differs morphologically from
this species in having slightly longer and narrower conidia which
taper slightly toward the ends, and in having larger, strongly lobed
appressoria.
An isolate deposited as C. gloeosporioides f. sp.
aeschynomenes in CBS (CBS 796.72) by G.E. Templeton, one of
the early C. gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomenes researchers
(Daniel et al. 1973), is genetically distinct to TeBeest 3.1.3 and has
been identified by Damm et al. (2012a, this issue) as C. godetiae, a
member of the C. acutatum complex. The strain that we examined
(Te Beest 3.1.3) matches genetically another strain often cited
in the C. gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomenes literature (Clar-
5a = ATCC 96723) (GenBank JX131331). It is possible that two
distinct species, both highly pathogenic to Aeschynomene in
Arkansas, have been confused. A survey of additional isolates of
Colletotrichum highly virulent to Aeschynomene in Arkansas would
clarify the interpretation of the past literature on this pathogen. For
example, C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. aeschynomenes” was initially
reported as specific to Aeschynomene virginica (Daniel et al.
1973), while later studies reported isolates putatively of the same
taxon, to have a wider host range (TeBeest 1988).
Cisar et al. (1994) reported fertile ascospores from
crosses between isolates identified as C. gloeosporioides “f.
sp. aeschynomenes” and isolates of C. gloeosporioides “f. sp.
jussiaeae”, a pathogen of Jussiaea decurrens. The position of
C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. jussiaeae” within our phylogeny is not
known, but these taxa could prove useful for better understanding
of the biological differences between phylogenetically defined
species of Colletotrichum.

Etymology: Based on C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. aeschynomenes”, referring to the host from which this species was originally described.

Holotype: USA, Arkansas, on Aeschynomene virginica stem lesion, coll. D. TeBeest 3-1-3, PDD 101995; ex-type culture ICMP 17673 = ATCC 201874.

Colony Description: Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA are 25–35 mm in diameter after 10 days. Aerial mycelium is sparse, cottony, and white, with the surface of the colony featuring numerous acervuli, some with dark bases, and orange conidial ooze. In reverse, the colony is more or less colorless apart from the dark acervuli and orange conidial masses showing through the agar. Conidia measure (14–)17–18.5(–20) × 4(–5) μm (average 17.6 × 4.1 μm, n = 30), cylindric, straight, and tapering slightly near both ends. Appressoria are mostly elliptic to subfusoid, deeply lobed. Perithecia were not observed.

Geographic Distribution and Host Range: Reported only from the USA, pathogenic to Aeschynomene virginica.

Genetic Identification: ITS sequences do not distinguish C. aeschynomenes from C. fructicola. These taxa are best distinguished using TUB2, GAPDH, or GS.

Notes: Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. aeschynomenes” has been used to refer to isolates pathogenic to Aeschynomene virginica and was later developed as the weed biocontrol agent Collego (Ditmore et al. 2008). It has also been reported from a range of other hosts (TeBeest 1988). Our analyses, based on a single, authentic strain of C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. aeschynomenes” (TeBeest 3.1.3), show it to be genetically distinct within the Musae clade of the C. gloeosporioides complex. It is genetically close to C. siamense but differs morphologically by having slightly longer and narrower conidia that taper toward the ends, and larger, strongly lobed appressoria.

An isolate deposited as C. gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomenes in CBS (CBS 796.72) by G.E. Templeton, one of the early researchers, is genetically distinct from TeBeest 3.1.3 and has been identified as C. godetiae, a member of the C. acutatum complex. The strain we examined (TeBeest 3.1.3) matches genetically another strain often cited in the C. gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomenes literature (Clar-5a = ATCC 96723) (GenBank JX131331). It is possible that two distinct species highly pathogenic to Aeschynomene in Arkansas have been confused. A survey of additional isolates of Colletotrichum highly virulent to Aeschynomene in Arkansas would clarify the past literature on this pathogen. For instance, C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. aeschynomenes” was initially reported as specific to Aeschynomene virginica (Daniel et al. 1973), but later studies reported isolates of the same taxon having a wider host range (TeBeest 1988).

Cisar et al. (1994) reported fertile ascospores from crosses between isolates identified as C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. aeschynomenes” and isolates of C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. jussiaeae”, a pathogen of Jussiaea decurrens. The position of C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. jussiaeae” within our phylogeny is not known, but these taxa could be useful for better understanding the biological differences between phylogenetically defined species of Colletotrichum.

(av. 18.9 × 5.2 μm, n = 40), cylindric, straight, ends rounded, a few
tapering towards the basal end. Appressoria mostly simple, elliptic
to fusoid in shape, sometime developing broad, irregular lobes,
about 7–13.5 × 5–10.5 μm. Perithecia not seen.
Geographic distribution and host range: Known only from yam
(Dioscorea alata), from Nigeria, Barbardos, India, Guadeloupe.
Genetic identification: ITS sequences distinguish C. alatae from all
other taxa.
Notes: Anthracnose diseases of yam are found throughout the
regions where the host is grown (e.g. Winch et al. 1984, Prasad &
Singh 1960, Singh et al. 1966, Abang et al. 2002, 2003). Isolates
from diseased yam leaves are morphologically (Winch et al. 1984)
and genetically (Abang et al. 2002) diverse. Both of these authors
used a broad species concept, grouping all isolates sourced from
yam under the single name C. gloeosporioides. In this paper we
accept part of that diversity to represent a distinct species, newly
described here as C. alatae. The type specimen of C. alatae
matches the SGG (slow growing grey) group of Abang et al. (2002),
the group that these authors found to be more pathogenic to yam
than the other morphological and genetic groups they recognised
within C. gloeosporioides. In addition to the Nigerian isolates of
Abang et al. (2002), isolates from yam from Barbados (isolates
SAS8 and SAS9 from Sreenivasaprasad et al. 1996), Guadeloupe
(GenBank accession GQ495617) and India (CBS 304.67 and
GenBank accession FJ940734) belong in this clade, while no
isolates from other hosts have been found.
Other isolates from yam that we sequenced included some
representing the Abang et al. (2002) FGS group (Abang Cg22 =
ICMP 18120, Abang Cg13 = ICMP 18125, Abang CgS6 = ICMP
18117, Abang CgS2 = ICMP 18121), a group distinguished from
the highly pathogenic SGG isolates by faster growth in culture and
shorter conidia (Abang et al. 2002). Two of these isolates (ICMP
18120, 18125) genetically match C. fructicola, the others match C.
siamense.
Several names have been applied to Colletotrichum
specimens from anthracnose of yam stems and leaves, including
Gloeosporium pestis Massee, G. “dioscoreae” Sawada (nom.
inval.; no Latin diagnosis), Colletotrichum dioscoreae Av.-Saccá
1917, and C. dioscoreae Tehon 1933. In addition, Gloeosporium
bomplandii Speg. was described from a host doubtfully
identified as Dioscorea. Because of the broad genetic diversity
of Colletotrichum spp. associated with diseased yam, the lack
of cultures from any of these early type specimens, and the
uncertainty to which part of the yam-associated diversity they
correspond, we have chosen not to use these names for our
newly recognised, yam-specialised pathogen. Whether the postharvest
tuber rot referred to as dead skin disease of yam (Abang
et al. 2003, Green & Simmons 1994) is caused by the same
Colletotrichum population as associated with diseased foliage is
not known.

The ex-holotype culture appears “stale,” with low, felted, dense, pale grey aerial mycelium, and an orange agar surface showing through near the margin. It has scattered dark-based acervuli with orange conidial masses near the center; in reverse, the colony is deep pinkish orange with patches of grey pigment near the center.

Genetic Identification: ITS sequences distinguish C. alatae from all other taxa.

Notes: Anthracnose diseases of yam are widespread in regions where the host is cultivated. Isolates from diseased yam leaves are morphologically and genetically diverse, but many were historically grouped under C. gloeosporioides. This paper recognizes part of that diversity as a distinct species, newly described as C. alatae. The type specimen of C. alatae matches the SGG (slow growing grey) group of Abang et al. (2002), which was found to be more pathogenic to yam than other groups they recognized. Isolates from Nigeria, Barbados, Guadeloupe, and India belong to this clade, while no isolates from other hosts have been identified.

Several names have been applied to Colletotrichum specimens from yam anthracnose, including Gloeosporium pestis Massee, G. dioscoreae Sawada, Colletotrichum dioscoreae Av.-Saccá, and C. dioscoreae Tehon. However, due to the broad genetic diversity and lack of cultures from these early type specimens, these names are not used for the newly recognized C. alatae. The relationship of postharvest tuber rot, known as dead skin disease of yam, to the foliage-associated pathogens remains unknown.

with an irregularly scalloped margin. Aerial mycelium cottony to
dense cottony, tufted near centre, grey to dark grey, scattered,
small, dark-based acervuli and large, globose, stromatic structures
partially embedded in agar, these sometimes splitting apart and
forming conidia. In reverse typically with pinkish-orange pigments,
variable in intensity, in some isolates this colour partially hidden

(12–)16–17.5(–21.5) × (4.5–)5–5.5(–6.5) μm (av. 16.9 × 5.2 μm,
n = 216), cylindric, straight, apex broadly rounded, often tapering

variable in shape, simple to broadly lobed, sometimes in groups,
sometimes intercalary, about 7–17 × 4–9.5 μm. Perithecia not seen
in culture.
Geographic distribution and host range: Confirmed only from New
Zealand, but GenBank records suggest C. aotearoa also occurs in
China (see below). In New Zealand this species is common on a
taxonomically diverse set of native plants, as both a fruit rot and a
leaf endophyte, and has also been isolated from leaves of several
species of naturalised weeds.
Genetic identification: ITS sequences do not separate C. aotearoa
from several taxa in the Kahawae and Musae clades. This species
can be distinguished using several other genes, including TUB2,
CAL, GS, and GAPDH.
Notes: All isolates in the C. gloeosporioides complex from New
Zealand native plants studied here belong in the Kahawae
clade, and most of these are C. aotearoa; a small number of leaf
endophyte isolates from New Zealand native trees are C. kahawae
subsp. ciggaro. The C. aotearoa isolates have been isolated as
endophytes from symptomless leaves as well as from rotting fruit
from native trees. Morphologically indistinguishable from isolates
of C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, this species is distinguished
genetically with all genes sampled, except ITS. The GAPDH gene
tree splits C. aotearoa into two well supported clades, but these do
not correlate to any other features, either geographic or biological.
Isolates associated with distinctive and common leaf spots on
Meryta sinclairii, first recorded by Beever (1984), belong in this
species. Whether isolates of C. aotearoa from other hosts are able
to cause the same disease on Meryta is not known.
Also in C. aotearoa are a range of isolates from weeds that
have become naturalised in New Zealand. We assume that C.
aotearoa is a New Zealand native species. It has a broad host
range amongst native plants and has apparently jumped host to
some weeds. It has never been found associated with cultivated
plants or as a rot of cultivated fruit.
Colletotrichum aotearoa may also occur in China. ITS
sequences from isolates from Boehmeria from China (GenBank
records GQ120479 and GQ120480) from Wang et al. (2010)
match exactly a set of C. aotearoa isolates. ITS between-species
differences within the C. gloeosporioides complex are very small,
so this match needs confirming with additional genes. C. aotearoa
was referred to as Undescribed Group 2 by Silva et al. (2012b).

Etymology: Based on the Maori name for New Zealand; most isolates from native New Zealand plants belong here.
Holotype: New Zealand, Auckland, Glen Innes, Auckland University campus, on Coprosma sp. incubated berries, collected by B. Weir C1282.4, 30 Apr. 2009, PDD 101076; ex-type culture ICMP 18537.

Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA reach 70–85 mm in diameter after 10 days, with several isolates showing restricted growth of 50–55 mm in diameter and an irregularly scalloped margin. Aerial mycelium is cottony to dense cottony, tufted near the center, grey to dark grey, with scattered small, dark-based acervuli and large, globose stromatic structures partially embedded in the agar, sometimes splitting apart and forming conidia. In reverse, colonies typically display pinkish-orange pigments, variable in intensity, with some isolates having this color partially obscured by more or less concentric bands of dark grey pigment. Conidia measure (12–) 16–17.5(–21.5) × (4.5–) 5–5.5(–6.5) μm (average 16.9 × 5.2 μm, n = 216), are cylindric, straight, with a broadly rounded apex and often tapering slightly towards the subtruncate base, 0-septate, and hyaline. Appressoria are variable in shape, from simple to broadly lobed, sometimes occurring in groups or intercalary, measuring about 7–17 × 4–9.5 μm. Perithecia have not been observed in culture.

Geographic distribution and host range: Confirmed only from New Zealand, but GenBank records suggest C. aotearoa may also occur in China. In New Zealand, this species is common on a taxonomically diverse set of native plants, acting as both a fruit rot and a leaf endophyte, and has been isolated from leaves of several naturalized weeds.
Genetic identification: ITS sequences do not separate C. aotearoa from several taxa in the Kahawae and Musae clades. It can be distinguished using several other genes, including TUB2, CAL, GS, and GAPDH.

Notes: All isolates in the C. gloeosporioides complex from New Zealand native plants studied belong to the Kahawae clade, with most identified as C. aotearoa; a small number of leaf endophyte isolates from New Zealand native trees are C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro. Isolates of C. aotearoa have been obtained as endophytes from symptomless leaves and from rotting fruit of native trees. Morphologically indistinguishable from isolates of C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, this species is distinguished genetically by all genes sampled except ITS. The GAPDH gene tree separates C. aotearoa into two well-supported clades, which do not correlate with any other geographic or biological features. Isolates associated with distinctive leaf spots on Meryta sinclairii, first recorded by Beever, belong to this species. It is uncertain whether isolates of C. aotearoa from other hosts can cause the same disease on Meryta.

Also classified as C. aotearoa are a range of isolates from weeds that have become naturalized in New Zealand. It is assumed that C. aotearoa is a New Zealand native species with a broad host range among native plants, having apparently jumped host to some weeds. It has never been found associated with cultivated plants or as a rot of cultivated fruit.

C. aotearoa may also occur in China. ITS sequences from isolates from Boehmeria in China match exactly a set of C. aotearoa isolates. The between-species differences in ITS within the C. gloeosporioides complex are very small, so this match requires confirmation with additional genes. C. aotearoa was referred to as Undescribed Group 2.

1899: 91. 1899.
Notes: Colletotrichum camelliae was described by Massee (in
Willis 1899) from the living leaves of tea (Camellia sinensis) from
Sri Lanka. It was placed in synonymy with C. gloeosporioides by
von Arx (1957). Although not listed by Hyde et al. (2009), the name
is widely used in the trade and semi-popular literature as the causal
agent of the brown blight disease of tea (e.g. Sosa de Castro et al.
2001, Muraleedharan & Baby 2007).
We have been unable to sample Colletotrichum isolates
from tea with typical brown blight symptoms. There are four
GenBank accessions of Colletotrichum from tea, two from China
(EU732732, FJ515007), one from Japan (AB218993), and
another from Iran (AB548281), referred variously to C. camelliae,
C. crassipes and C. gloeosporioides. Although ITS sequences
only are available for these geographically widespread isolates,
the DNA sequence of the Iranian isolate appears to match C.
gloeosporioides s. str., while those from the other three isolates
are all very similar to each other. The ITS sequence from these
isolates matches that of CBS 232.79, from tea shoots from Java
(GenBank JX009429). GAPDH and ITS sequences from CBS
232.79 (GenBank JX009417, JX009429) place this isolate in C.
fructicola. Note that CBS 571.88, isolated from tea from China
and deposited as Glomerella cingulata, is a Colletotrichum sp.
outside C. gloeosporioides s. lat., based on ITS sequences
(GenBank JX009424).
We tested the pathogenicity of CBS 232.79 and isolates of G.
cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” (see below) using detached tea leaves
and found that only the G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” isolates were
strong pathogens (unpubl. data).
The genetic relationship between the pathogen of ornamental
Camellia (here referred to G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae”), isolates
from tea with DNA sequence data in GenBank, and isolates
associated with brown blight symptoms of tea remain unresolved.
Additional isolates with known pathogenicity, collected from typical
brown blight symptoms from the field, are required to determine
whether or not there are two distinct pathogens of Camellia, one of
tea, the other of ornamental varieties.
Other Colletotrichum species reported from tea include C.
“theae-sinensis”, an invalid recombination of Gloeosporium theaesinensis
I. Miyake, proposed by Yamamoto (1960). Moriwaki and
Sato (2009) summarised the taxonomic history of this name and
transferred G. theae-sinensis to Discula on the basis of DNA
sequences. Sphaerella camelliae Cooke and its recombination
Laestadia camelliae (Cooke) Berl. & Voglino were listed by von Arx
& Müller (1954) as synonyms of Glomerella cingulata. This species
is now accepted as Guignardia camelliae (Cooke) E.J. Butler ex
Petch and is regarded as the causal agent of copper blight disease

development of perithecia in cultures initiated from conidia of what
she considered its asexual morph, Gloeosporium cingulatum. There

Notes: Stoneman (1898) described Glomerella cingulata from diseased stems of Ligustrum vulgare in the USA and reported the development of perithecia in cultures initiated from conidia of what she considered its asexual morph, Gloeosporium cingulatum. Recent reports indicate anthracnose diseases of Ligustrum (e.g., Alfieri et al. 1984, Vajna & Bagyinka 2002), but the relationship of isolates causing this disease to the C. gloeosporioides complex is not known.

Glomerella cingulata is often taxonomically linked to the anamorph Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, and the name has historically been applied broadly to C. gloeosporioides s. lat. (e.g., Small 1926, von Arx & Müller 1954). However, it is unlikely that the type specimen of G. cingulata represents the same species as C. gloeosporioides s. str. (see notes under C. gloeosporioides). Colletotrichum gloeosporioides s. str. is not known to form perithecia in culture, and no isolates of C. gloeosporioides s. str. have been associated with a Glomerella state on diseased stems of Ligustrum. An isolate of C. aotearoa (ICMP 18748) was isolated from Ligustrum lucidum in New Zealand, but it was not associated with a stem lesion, and no C. aotearoa isolates were observed forming perithecia.",What is the historical context of the classification of Glomerella cingulata and its relationship with Gloeosporium cingulatum?,How does the development of perithecia in cultures relate to the classification of Glomerella cingulata and its asexual morph?,What uncertainties exist regarding the relationship between isolates causing anthracnose diseases of Ligustrum and the C. gloeosporioides complex?,Was Glomerella cingulata originally described from diseased stems of Ligustrum vulgare in the USA?,Is Glomerella cingulata commonly linked to the anamorph Colletotrichum gloeosporioides?,Have isolates of C. gloeosporioides s. str. been associated with a Glomerella state on diseased stems of Ligustrum?,The Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex.pdf

1989). Figs 18, 19.
Notes: Dickens & Cook (1989) proposed the name Glomerella
cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” for isolates morphologically typical of
C. gloeosporioides s. lat. that were highly pathogenic to leaves and
shoots of ornamental Camellia saluenensis hybrids, causing the
disease Camellia twig blight. These authors reported the fungus
from plants imported into the UK from New Zealand and noted that
a similar disease had been reported from plants grown in the UK,
USA, Australia, France, and Italy. The disease has been reported
from Camellia japonica, C. reticulata, and C. sasanqua. Although
isolated in the UK from plants imported from New Zealand, this
pathogen has not yet been found on Camellia plants growing in
New Zealand.
We have sequenced authentic isolates cited by Dickens &
Cook (1989) as well as isolates pathogenic to Camellia saluenensis
collected from the USA. They are similar to each other genetically
as well as biologically and morphologically. ITS sequences alone
distinguish G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” from all other taxa in the
C. gloeosporioides complex, and there is good genetic evidence to
consider these isolates to be representative of a distinct species
within the C. kahawae clade. A new species is not proposed here
because the relationship between the G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae”
isolates and C. camelliae, the fungus causing brown blight of tea,
remains uncertain.
Dickens & Cook (1989) also reported two C. acutatum strains
from ornamental Camellia species that were avirulent in tests
with detached Camellia cv. Donation leaves. Strain IMI 351261,
deposited 1992 in IMI by R. Cook, is likely to be one of them. This
strain was confirmed as belonging to the C. acutatum species
complex and identified as C. lupini, which causes lupin anthracnose
and is occasionally found on other hosts (Damm et al. 2012a, this
issue). Another strain from Camellia reticulata from China belongs
to C. fioriniae, also a species in the C. acutatum complex, while
a strain from New Zealand (ICMP 10338) is C. boninense s. str.
(Damm et al. 2012a, b, this issue).

Geographic distribution and host range: First reported from
Clidemia, native to Panama, and subsequently introduced to
Hawai’i as a pathogen of that host. Genetically matching isolates
occur on native Vitis and Quercus spp. in Florida (see notes below).
Genetic identification: ITS sequences do not separate C. clidemiae
from C. aotearoa. The two species are best distinguished using
ACT, GAPDH, or GS.
Notes: Isolates referred to C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. clidemiae” by
Trujillo et al. (1986) were highly pathogenic to Clidemia, but not to
the other species of Melastomataceae tested. No voucher cultures
of the original isolates collected from Panama were kept, but
recent specimens isolated from naturalised Clidemia hirta plants in
Hawai’i with typical disease symptoms are genetically uniform and
distinct within the Kahawae clade. Phylogenetic, biological, and
morphological evidence support this fungus being described as a
new species within the C. gloeosporioides complex.
A fungus isolated from a Vitis sp. in Florida and referred to as
“Glomerella cingulata native host” by MacKenzie et al. (2007), is
genetically close to our isolates from Clidemia and is here referred
to the same species. Data in MacKenzie et al. (2007) shows the
same fungus occurs on both Vitis and Quercus in Florida. Micromorphologically
the isolates from Clidemia and from Vitis that
we examined are similar with respect to the size and shape of
appressoria, conidia, and ascospores. They are distinct in cultural
appearance, the cultures of the Vitis-associated fungus having
aerial mycelium darker and more dense, and a faster growth rate.
Similar variation in cultural appearance is present in several of the
phylogenetically defined species that we recognise. Whether or
not the Clidemia-associated isolates are biologically distinct from
the Vitis- and Quercus-associated isolates from Florida requires
pathogenicity tests to determine.

Notes: Described from leaves of Cordyline indivisa from a botanical
garden in Italy, the genetic and biological status of this species is not
known. Two Cordyline-associated species are accepted in this study,
C. cordylinicola from Thailand and the newly described C. ti from New
Zealand. The original description of C. cordylines is brief (Pollacci
1899) but it specifically mentions setae more than 100 μm long.
Colletotrichum cordylinicola is described as lacking setae (Phoulivong
et al. 2011) and in C. ti they are rare and when present much less than
100 μm long. The phylogenetic significance of this apparent difference
and confirmation that these names represent different fungi requires
DNA sequences to be generated from type material of C. cordylines.

Phoulivong et al. (2011) provide a description.
Geographic distribution and host range: Known only from Cordyline
from Thailand and Eugenia from Laos.
Genetic identification: ITS sequences separate C. cordylinicola
from all other species.
Notes: Phoulivong et al. (2011) report C. cordylinicola from
Cordyline (Agavaceae) and Eugenia (Myrtaceae). They noted
that the isolate from Eugenia was not pathogenic to Cordyline and
vice versa, and they also showed that the specimens from the
two hosts are genetically somewhat distinct, although forming a
sister relationship amongst the taxa included in their analysis. The
calmodulin gene tree generated from our sequence data together
with the sequences provided by Phoulivong et al. (2011) (GenBank
accession HM470236) supports placing the isolates from Eugenia
and from Cordyline in the same species (unpubl. data).
Colletotrichum cordylinicola is genetically distinct from a
species associated with Cordyline leaf spots from New Zealand,
described here as C. ti. See also notes under C. cordylines.

and FN599818; CBS 109355 – FN557346 and FN599819).
Those with no isolates in a public collection include C. kahawae
subsp. ciggaro (CORCS3 cited in Yang et al. (2011), HM584410,
HM582002, HM585412), C. fructicola (strain 080912009 Jining,
unpubl. data, FJ515007), and a possibly undescribed species
within the Kahawae clade (strain SYJM02, unpubl. data,
JF923835). Originally described from the berries of Vitis vinifera
from Italy (Spegazzini 1878), the identity of C. crassipes remains
unresolved. There is confusion regarding its morphology. Von Arx
(1970) uses the name C. crassipes for fungi in which setae are
rare, conidia are 22–34 × 6–8 μm (more or less matching the
original description), and the lobed appressoria are distinctively
globose in shape. Sutton (1980) uses a different morphological
concept – setae common (according to Sutton these are rare in the
otherwise morphologically similar C. musae), conidia 10–15 × 4.5–
6.5 μm (Sutton’s concept of C. gloeosporioides is characterised by
narrower conidia), and the appressoria deeply lobed. The conidial
width cited for C. gloeosporioides by Sutton (1980), 3–4.5 μm, is
narrower than we have found for all the taxa we accept within C.
gloeosporioides s. lat., whereas his C. crassipes measurement of
4.5–6.5 μm matches many of the taxa we recognise. Several of
these taxa also have deeply lobed appressoria.

Notes: Farr et al. (2006) examined the type specimen of this
species and concluded it was a member of C. gloeosporioides s.
lat., based on conidial size and shape. Genetic data is not available
to confirm this. See also discussion under C. petchii in Damm et al.

Colletotrichum fragariae A.N. Brooks, Phytopathology 21:
113. 1931.
Notes: Placed here in synonymy with C. theobromicola. See notes
and additional specimens examined under C. theobromicola.
The name C. fragariae was originally applied to isolates
associated with a disease of strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa)
runners (stolons) and petioles in Florida (Brooks 1931). Although
the name was placed in synonymy with C. gloeosporioides by
von Arx (1957), it has continued to be used in the literature for
strawberry-associated Colletotrichum isolates. It was accepted as
distinct by Sutton (1992), although he noted confusion surrounding
application of the name. Designation of one of Brook’s cultures
(CBS 142.31 = IMI 346325) as the epitype of C. fragariae by Buddie
et al. (1999) has allowed a modern, genetic basis for this name to
be fixed. The ex-epitype culture of C. fragariae sits in a strongly
supported clade containing isolates from a wide range of hosts
from many parts of the world, including the ex-epitype culture of C.
theobromicola, an earlier name for C. fragariae in the sense that we
accept these species in this paper.
There are several species from the C. gloeosporioides
complex which inhabit diseased strawberry plants, and as shown
by MacKenzie et al. (2007, 2008) isolates that genetically match
the epitype of C. fragariae have a wide host range. Despite its
name MacKenzie et al. (2007, 2008) regarded this fungus as
simply one of a group of several species sometimes found on
strawberry. Our study confirms that members of the C. fragariae/
theobromicola clade occur throughout the world on a wide range of
hosts. Within the diversity of the C. fragariae/theobromicola clade,
there is a subclade consisting of the C. fragariae epitype and two
contemporary ex-strawberry isolates from the USA (Fig. 1), further
work will be needed to establish if the strawberry stolon disease is
restricted to this subclade. Despite regular surveys this disease has
not been found on strawberries in New Zealand.
Xie et al. (2010b) provides a good example of the confusion
that continues to surround the application of Colletotrichum names
to isolates from strawberry. These authors noted that putative C.
gloeosporioides and C. fragariae isolates were difficult to distinguish
using ITS sequences, the only sequences that they generated.
Xie et al. (2010b) found 4 groups of isolates, each with a slightly
different ITS sequence, two of those groups they considered to
be C. fragariae and two to be C. gloeosporioides. To classify their
isolates as either C. fragariae of C. gloeosporioides they used a
restriction enzyme method based on Martinez-Culebras et al.
(2000). Incorporating their ITS sequences into our ITS alignment,
one of their groups genetically matches C. tropicale, one matches
C. gloeosporioides s. str., one matches C. fructicola, and one
matches C. siamense. These relationships are based on ITS
sequences only — the genetic differences between some of these
species are small and are indicative only of possible relationships.
However, it is clear that none of the Xie et al. (2010b) sequences
match those of the epitype of C. fragariae. There are also several
species within the C. acutatum species complex associated with
Fragaria (Damm et al. 2012, this issue).

Prihastuti et al. (2009) and Rojas et al. (2010) provide descriptions.
Geographic distribution and host range: Originally reported
from coffee berries from Thailand (as C. fructicola) and as a
leaf endophyte from several plants in Central America (as C.
ignotum), isolates that we accept as C. fructicola are biologically
and geographically diverse. Known from Coffea from Thailand,
Pyrus pyrifolia from Japan, Limonium from Israel, Malus domestica
and Fragaria × ananassa from the USA, Persea americana from
Australia, Ficus from Germany, Malus domestica from Brazil,
Dioscorea from Nigeria, and Theobroma and Tetragastris from
Panama.
Genetic identification: ITS sequences do not separate C. fructicola
from C. aeschynomenes and some C. siamense isolates. These
taxa are best distinguished using GS or SOD2.
Notes: Rojas et al. (2010) noted the occurrence of two distinct
haplotype subgroups (A4-3 and A5-4) within their concept of C.
ignotum. Our genetic analyses resolve the two clades representative
of these two subgroups. However, together they are monophyletic
within the Musae clade of the C. gloeosporioides complex, and we
retain them here as a single species. Both clades include isolates
from a wide range of hosts from many countries, and both are
similar in morphology and cultural appearance. The types of both
C. fructicola and C. ignotum are in the same haplotype subgroup.
The C. fructicola protologue designates the holotype as MFLU
090228, but the culture derived from holotype as “BCC” with no
specimen number. The ex-holotype culture is listed as BDP-I16 in
Table 1 of Prihastuti et al. (2009) but this number is not mentioned
in the description. Culture BDP-I16 was obtained from the authors
(Prihastuti et al. 2009) for this study and deposited as ICMP 18581.

Cannon et al. (2008) provide a description of the species.
Geographic distribution and host range: Most isolates of C.
gloeosporioides are associated with Citrus, and in many parts of
the world this fungus is common on Citrus, but it also occurs on
other hosts including Ficus, Mangifera, Pueraria, and Vitis. The
isolate reported as a pathogen of paper mulberry (Broussonetia
papyrifera) by Yan et al. (2011) matches C. gloeosporioides s. str.
genetically.
Genetic identification: ITS separates C. gloeosporioides from all
other species.
Notes: The name Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is currently in
common use in two senses, one a genetically and biologically
broad sense more or less following von Arx (1957, 1970) and
Sutton (1992), including the whole species complex, the other a
strict sense, encompassing only those specimens genetically
matching the epitype selected for this name by Cannon et al.
(2008). Depending on the context, use of the name in either
sense can be useful. When used in a broad sense in this paper,
it is referred to as the C. gloeosporioides species complex or C.
gloeosporioides s. lat.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is often linked taxonomically to
the teleomorph Glomerella cingulata, see notes under G. cingulata.

Notes: Originally described from Aleurites fordii and A. montaba
from French Equatorial Africa, these names have not been used
since being described and the genetic relationship of this fungus
to and within the C. gloeosporioides species complex is unknown.
Although the original publications have not been seen, both names

et al. 1986).
Notes: See Colletotrichum clidemiae.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. cucurbitae”
(Menten et al. 1980).
Notes: First described from cucumber, this fungus is widely
regarded as a synonym of C. orbiculare in the plant pathology
literature (e.g. Snowdon 1991, da Silva et al. 2011).
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. cuscutae” (Zhang
1985).
Notes: A strain identified by this name was developed as a
mycoherbicide against dodder (Cuscuta chinensis in China (Zhang
1985). This strain referred to as “Lu Bao No.1” is apparently
included in the study of Guerber et al. (2003) as strain 783 and
belongs to the C. acutatum species complex. Other strains from
dodder in the USA included in the same study were revealed to be
C. fioriniae, while a strain from Dominica was found to represent a
new species, both belonging to the C. acutatum species complex
as well (Damm et al. 2012, this issue).
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides var. gomphrenae Perera,

Basionym: Colletotrichum heveae Petch, Ann. Roy. Bot. Gard.
Peradeniya 3(1): 8. 1906.
Notes: Originally described from the leaves of seedlings of Hevea
brasiliensis from Sri Lanka, this fungus was described with very
broad conidia, 18–24 × 7.5–8 μm. Carpenter & Stevenson (1954)
considered this, and several other Colletotrichum, Gloeosporium
and Glomerella species described from rubber, to be synonyms of
C. gloeosporioides. The genetic relationship of these species to
and within the C. gloeosporioides species complex is unknown. See
also notes in Damm et al. (2012b, this issue) under Colletotrichum
annelatum.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. hyperici” (Harris
1993).
Notes: This name was first used by Harris (1993) for strains of
C. gloeosporioides pathogenic to Hypericum perforatum. Earlier
studies by Hildebrand & Jensen (1991) had found the Hypericum
pathogen to be pathogenic also on several other plants. The
genetic relationship of the Hypericum pathogen to and within the
C. gloeosporioides species complex is unknown. Note that the exholotype
culture of G. cingulata var. migrans, a variety here placed
in synonymy with C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, was also isolated
from Hypericum.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. jussiaeae” (Boyette
et al. 1979).
Notes: Strains identified as C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. jussiaeae” are
highly pathogenic, specialised pathogens of Jussiaea decurrens
(Boyette et al. 1979). The genetic relationship of this taxon to and
within the C. gloeosporioides species complex, or to Colletotrichum
jussiaeae Earle, is unknown. Isolates pathogenic to Jussiaea have
a similar conidial germination self-inhibitor profile to another isolate
identified as C. fragariae (Tsurushima et al. 1995). The authentic
isolate of C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. jussiaeae” deposited as ATCC
52634, is not included in this study.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. malvae” (Makowski
& Mortensen 1989).
Notes: Strains identified as C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. malvae” were
registered as a bioherbicide against round leafed mallow in Canada
(Makowski & Mortensen 1989). The fungus was subsequently
recognised as belonging to the C. orbiculare species complex
(Bailey et al. 1996).

Notes: See Colletotrichum manihotis.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f. melongenae Fournet,
Ann. Mus. Civico Storia Nat. Genova 5: 13. 1973.
Notes: In addition to C. gloeosporioides f. melongenae, the names
C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. melongenae”, C. melongenae Av.-
Saccá 1917, and C. melongenae Lobik 1928 have been used to
refer to fungi associated with anthracnose diseases of Solanum
melongena (e.g. Sherf & McNab 1986, Kaan 1973). Other names
used for isolates from the same host have included Gloeosporium
melongenae Ellis & Halst. 1891 and G. melongenae Sacc. 1916.
The genetic relationships of these eggplant-associated taxa to and
within the C. gloeosporioides species complex remain unknown.
Solanum melongena associated species are known also from the
C. boninense species complex (Damm et al. 2012b, this issue).
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. miconiae” (Killgore
et al. 1999).
Notes: Killgore et al. (1999) reported that the isolates they
recognised as C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. miconiae” were highly
specialised pathogens of Miconia calvescens, unable to infect
the closely related Clidemia hirta. The original voucher cultures
are no longer available (pers. comm., Robert Barreto). Recently
collected isolates from Miconia from the type locality in Brazil have
proved to be genetically diverse across the C. gloeosporioides
species complex, with isolates in both the Kahawae and Musae
clades (unpubl. data). For now the genetic position of this pathogen
remains unresolved.

relationship to and within the C. gloeosporioides species complex
is unknown.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. ortheziidae”
(Marcelino et al. 2008).
Notes: Marcelino et al. (2008) clearly show that the Orthezia
praelonga pathogen belongs in the C. acutatum species complex,
despite referring to the fungus only as C. gloeosporioides “f. sp.
ortheziidae”. See also notes under C. nymphaeae in Damm et al.
(2012a, this issue).
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. pilosae” (Singh

Notes: First described from leaves of Bidens pilosa, this name has
not been used since it was described and its genetic relationship
to and within the C. gloeosporioides species complex is unknown.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis Munaut,
Mycol. Res. 106: 591. 2002.
Notes: Placed here in synonymy with C. theobromicola; see notes
under C. theobromicola.
Irwin & Cameron (1978) and Munaut et al. (2002) described
different diseases of Stylosanthes associated with Type A and Type
B isolates of C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis, the two groups of
isolates distinguished morphologically by growth rate in culture and
by conidial morphology. Compared with Type A, the Type B isolates
had a slower growth rate on PDA, and conidia more variable in size
and shape (Irwin & Cameron 1978). They were also distinguished
genetically using RFLP and similar methods (e.g. Munaut et al.
1998, 2002). Munaut et al. (2002) used ITS1 sequences to show
the C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis to be related to an isolate they
identified as C. fragariae. We regard C. fragariae to be a synonym
of C. theobromicola, with putatively authentic Type A (HM335, C.
gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis “f. sp. guianensis”) and Type B (HM
336, C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis “f. sp. stylosanthis”) isolates
both also belonging to this species. From the ITS1 sequence data
available, isolates regarded as typical of Type A (RAPD cluster I)
and of Type B (RAPD cluster II) by Munaut et al. (1998) all belong
in C. theobromicola in the sense that we are using the name; their
RAPD cluster III isolate could be C. tropicale, and their RAPD
cluster IV isolates are probably C. fructicola.
The cultures of C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis that we used
were originally studied by Irwin & Cameron (1978), and selected
as the “types” of “f. sp. guianensis” and “f. sp. stylosanthis” by
Munaut et al. (2002). Both isolates have a ‘stale’ growth form, no
longer forming conidia in culture and with aerial mycelium closely
appressed to the agar surface, resulting in an almost slimy colony
surface. Both isolates had a slow growth rate, similar to that
reported for Type B isolates by Irwin & Cameron (1978). Genetically
both isolates were identical for all the genes we sequenced. This
identity should be checked against additional isolates, especially
some matching Type A sensu Irwin & Cameron (1978) with respect
to both pathogenicity and growth form.
Sherriff et al. (1994), using ITS2 and partial 28S rDNA
sequences, found isolates they considered to represent C.
gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis Type A and Type B respectively to
be genetically distinct. However, their ITS2 sequences show that
the putative Type B isolate in their study was in fact a member of
the C. boninense species complex.

Colletotrichum gossypii Southw., J. Mycol. 6: 100. 1891.
= Glomerella gossypii Edgerton, Mycologia 1: 119. 1909.
Notes: This species was originally described from the USA and was
reported to cause disease symptoms on all parts of cotton plants,
but especially the bolls (Southworth 1891, Edgerton 1909). Isolates
identified as C. gossypii by Shear & Wood (1907) were reportedly
associated with a Glomerella state in culture, and Edgerton (1909)
described Glomerella gossypii from diseased, mature cotton plants
in the USA Edgerton (1909) discussed differences in ascospore
shape between G. gossypii and fruit-rotting isolates of G.
cingulata, with G. gossypii having elliptic, not curved ascospores.
Von Arx (1957) considered C. gossypii to be a synonym of C.
gloeosporioides and von Arx & Müller (1954) regarded G. gossypii
to be a synonym of G. cingulata.
Modern authors have recognised two pathogens of cotton, C.
gossypii and C. gossypii var. cephalosporioides. Colletotrichum
gossypii is reportedly the cause of cotton anthracnose, a damping-off
disease of cotton seedlings, and C. gossypii var. cephalosporioides
the cause of ramulosis, a disease causing abnormal branching
of mature plants (Bailey et al. 1996, Silva-Mann et al. 2005). In
a study based on ITS2 sequences, Bailey et al. (1996) found C.
gossypii and C. gossypii var. cephalosporioides to be genetically
distinct but with both belonging to the C. gloeosporioides species
complex. Silva-Mann et al. (2005) also distinguished the two
taxa genetically, based on an AFLP analysis. The only DNA
sequences available for isolates identified as C. gossypii and C.
gossypii var. cephalosporioides are ITS2 and the D2 region of
the rDNA LSU, neither of which resolves their relationships within
the C. gloeosporioides complex. Whether the seedling pathogen
regarded by Silva-Mann et al. (2005) and Bailey et al. (1996) to be
C. gossypii represents the species first described from cotton in
the USA is not known. The genetic relationship of these apparently
biologically specialised fungi requires additional sequences to be
generated from authentic isolates with known pathogenicity.

Geographic distribution and host range: Associated with fruit and

Zealand. Xie et al. (2010a) noted minor symptoms on inoculated
fruit of Capsicum annuum, Musa acuminata, and Cucurbita pepo,

Notes: Placed here in synonymy with Colletotrichum siamense.
See notes and additional specimens examined under C. siamense.
Yang et al. (2009) reported this species as a leaf pathogen of
Hymenocallis americana. They distinguished C. hymenocallidis
from C. siamense, also described from Hymenocallis, primarily
on the basis of a multi-gene phylogeny and differences in colony
colour. Although gene selection was appropriate for resolving
genetic relationships within the C. gloeosporioides group, Yang
et al. (2009) included only five isolates of the C. gloeosporioides
complex in their phylogeny. Based on this isolate selection, the
C. hymenocallidis isolates were genetically distinct from the
C. siamense isolates. However, in our analysis, in which the C.
siamense/C. hymenocallidis group is represented by 30 isolates
from a wide range of hosts from all over the world, authentic isolates
of the two species fall within a monophyletic clade that cannot be
further subdivided phylogenetically.
The Latin part of the C. hymenocallidis protologue designates
a culture (“Holotypus: Cultura (CSSN2)”) as the holotype but
the English citation of the type specimen corrects this apparent
mistake, citing CSSN2 as an ex-holotype culture, with the herbarium
specimen GZAAS 080001 as the holotype.

306,"* Colletotrichum kahawae J.M. Waller & Bridge subsp.
kahawae, Mycol. Res. 97: 993. 1993. Fig. 25.
Waller et al. (1993) provide a description.
Geographic distribution and host range: Known only from Coffea
from Africa.
Genetic identification: ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, TUB2, SOD2,
and ITS sequences are the same as those from C. kahawae
subsp. ciggaro. The two subspecies can be distinguished by GS
sequences; C. kahawae subsp. kahawae has a 22 bp deletion and
a single C to T transition. Collectively, the two subspecies can be
distinguished from all other species using ITS sequences alone.
Notes: Colletotrichum kahawae was proposed by Waller et al. (1993)
as a name to refer specifically to Colletotrichum isolates causing
Coffee Berry Disease (CBD), to taxonomically distinguish these
disease-causing isolates from the several other Colletotrichum
spp. that can be isolated from coffee plants, including C. coffeanum
(see notes under C. coffeanum). Colletotrichum kahawae is an
apparently clonal population (Varzea et al. 2002), widespread on
coffee in Africa, and with a distinctive growth form and biology
(Waller et al. 1993).
In this paper C. kahawae sensu Waller et al. (1993) is reduced
to subspecies. Based on ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, TUB2, SOD2,
and ITS gene sequences the coffee berry pathogen cannot be
distinguished from isolates from a wide range of other hosts that
are not pathogenic to coffee. Those other isolates are referred to
here as C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro. We retain a distinct taxonomic
label for the coffee berry pathogen to reflect its biosecurity
importance. In addition to its biology, C. kahawae subsp. kahawae
can be distinguished metabolically, and genetically using GS gene
sequences. Waller et al. (1993) used a metabolic test, an inability
to utilise either citrate or tartrate as a sole carbon source, to help
characterise isolates as C. kahawae. None of our C. kahawae
subsp. kahawae isolates were able to utilise either citrate or tartrate,
whereas all of the C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro isolates were able
to utilise one or both of these carbon sources (Weir & Johnston
2009). All of the C. kahawae subsp. kahawae isolates share a 22
bp deletion in the glutamine synthetase gene, lacking in the C.
kahawae subsp. ciggaro isolates. Note that one of the isolates
metabolically and genetically typical C. kahawae subsp. kahawae
(CBS 982.69) was reported by Gielink & Vermeulen (1983) to be
non-pathogenic to coffee, but we have not independently checked
this result.
The isolates we accept as C. kahawae subsp. kahawae show
two cultural types, one matching the description of Waller et al.
(1993), slow growing, darkly pigmented cultures with conidia
developing mostly in the aerial mycelium. The second cultural type
grew even more slowly, had little or no pigmentation within the agar,
and the colony surface was covered with numerous acervuli and
orange conidial masses. Metabolically and genetically both cultural
types were the same, and pathogenicity tests showed that the nonpigmented
isolates caused CBD (unpubl. data, D. Silva, Centro de
Investigação das Ferrugens do Cafeeiro). Rodriguez et al. (1991)
reported further variation in cultural appearance amongst CBD
causing isolates.
Waller et al. 1993 stated that C. kahawae was not known to form
ascospores. However, Gielink & Vermeulen (1983) observed the
production of perithecia on coffee berries that had been inoculated
with CBD-causing isolates, many months after inoculation and death
of the berries. At least one of the isolates that they cited with this
biology, CBS 135.30, has the GS sequence typical of C. kahawae
subsp. kahawae. Vermeulen et al. (1984) grew cultures from the
perithecia that developed on the previously inoculated berries, and
found that none were pathogenic to coffee. It is possible that the
perithecia developing on inoculated berries reported by Gielink &
Vermeulen (1983) were from other Colletotrichum spp. present on
the berries before they were inoculated, and represented species
distinct from C. kahawae subsp. kahawae. A similar situation has
been noted with some of our inoculations, where species present
on tissues prior to inoculation, either endophytic or latent, started
to sporulate on the dead tissue following inoculation (unpubl. data,
B.S. Weir).
Based on ITS sequences, most of the accessions in GenBank
identified as C. kahawae and isolated from coffee, match our
concept of C. kahawae subsp. kahawae. There are two exceptions,
AF534468 (from Malawi) and AY376540 (STE-U 5295 = IMI 319424
= CBS 112985, from Kenya). The Kenyan isolate was cited as C.
kahawae in Lubbe et al. (2004). Based on the ITS sequences, and
the TUB2 sequence from isolate STE-U 5295 (AY376588), these
isolates represent C. siamense.

1989, PDD 102232; ex-type culture ICMP 18539.
Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA 75–85 mm diam
after 10 d for most isolates, the ex-holotype culture of G. cingulata
var. migrans 48–49 mm diam. Aerial mycelium cottony, grey, dense,
or in some isolates with dark stromatic masses and associated
orange conidial ooze showing through mycelium from agar
surface; in reverse agar with pinkish-orange pigments (6B4–7B4),
irregular scattered black spots, and variable levels of development
of overlying dark grey to green-grey pigments (4C2–5D4), these
sometimes in discrete sectors. See notes below about a divergent
growth form single ascospore cultures from perithecia in culture.
Conidia form on dark-based acervuli, (12–)16–19.5(–29) × (4.5–)
5(–8) μm (av. 17.8 × 5.1 μm, n = 214), cylindric, straight, apex
rounded, often tapering slightly towards the base. Appressoria
typically cylindric to fusoid in shape, deeply lobed. Perithecia
numerous, forming tightly packed clumps, individual perithecia
globose, small, about 250 μm diam, with a short ostiolar neck. Asci
55–100 × 10–12 μm, 8–spored. Ascospores (13.5–)17.5–20(–24)
× (4–)4.5–5(–6.5) μm (av. 18.8 × 4.8 μm, n = 121), gently curved,
tapering to quite narrow, rounded ends, widest point usually
towards one end of the spore.
Geographic distribution and host range: Known from Australia,
Germany, New Zealand, and South Africa. Both host and geographic
range of the isolates we accept in C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro
are broad. Genetic identification: ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH,
TUB2, SOD2, and ITS sequences match those from C. kahawae
subsp. kahawae. The two subspecies can be distinguished by GS
sequences. Collectively, the two subspecies can be distinguished
from all other species using ITS sequences alone.
Notes: The authentic isolate of G. cingulata var. migrans (CBS 237.49)
differed from all other isolates we accept in C. kahawae subsp.
ciggaro by its slower growth rate. Wollenweber & Hochapfel (1949)
distinguished Glomerella cingulata var. migrans from G. cingulata var.
cingulata on the basis of pathogenicity (G. cingulata var. migrans was
pathogenic to Hypericum and not to apple) and because of its slightly
longer ascospores and shorter conidia — ascospores average 21 ×
4.2 μm versus 18 × 4.6 μm, conidia average 14 × 5.2 μm versus 18 ×
5 μm (Wollenweber & Hochapfel 1949). We were unable to produce
ascospores from CBS 237.49, the conidia were similar in size to that
reported by Wollenweber & Hochapfel (1949), averaging 16.6 × 5.3
μm. However, the average ascospore and conidial lengths of our C.
kahawae subsp. ciggaro isolates varied across the range cited by
Wollenweber & Hochapfel (1949) for both G. cingulata var. cingulata
and G. cingulata var. migrans, the average ascospore length from
individual isolates ranging from 16.6 to 20 μm, the average conidial
length ranging from 14.9 to 21.2 μm.
Glomerella rufomaculans var. vaccinii was described by Shear
(1907) for a fungus isolated from cranberry that was morphologically
identical to isolates from apple and other hosts but which appeared
to be biologically distinct (Shear 1907, Shear & Wood 1913). A
putatively authentic isolate of this species, deposited by Shear
in CBS in 1922, matches C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro genetically.
Polashock et al. (2009) discussed the diversity of Colletotrichum
close match between their isolates and C. kahawae. Incorporation
of their ITS sequences into our alignment confirms this. Whether or
not there is a genetically distinct, cranberry specialised taxon within
C. kahawae requires additional genes to be sequenced from the
cranberry-associated isolates.
Colletotrichum kahawae subsp. ciggaro was referred to as C.
gloeosporioides Group B by Johnston & Jones (1997) and Johnston
et al. (2005), and as Undescribed Group 1 by Silva et al. (2012b).
Single ascospore isolates derived from perithecia forming in
single conidial cultures of the avocado-associated isolates of C.
kahawae subsp. ciggaro from New Zealand showed two highly
divergent growth forms (Fig. 27F). One typical of the “wild type”
(cottony, grey to dark grey aerial mycelium with dark-based acervuli
and orange conidial masses visible through the mycelium, in
reverse with pinkish-orange pigmentation, in places this masked by
irregular patches or sectors of dark grey pigmentation), the other
more or less lacking aerial mycelium, the surface of the colony
covered with small, pale-based acervuli with bright orange conidial
ooze, in reverse bright orange from the conidial ooze. Although

Colletotrichum manihotis Henn., Hedwigia 43: 94. 1904.
Notes: Anthracnose is an important disease of cassava (e.g.
Chevaugeon 1956, Makambila 1994, Fokunang et al. 2000,
Owolade et al. 2008), variously referred to Colletotrichum manihotis,
Gloeosporium manihotis Henn., Glomerella manihotis (Sacc.)
Petr., Glomerella cingulata “f. sp. manihotis”, or C. gloeosporioides
“f. sp. manihotis”. The original descriptions of both C. manihotis
and Gloeosporium manihotis are of species with short, broad
conidia (8–15 × 4–6 μm), and Chevaugeon (1956) regarded all of
these cassava-associated fungi as con-specific. However, based
on Fokunang et al. (2000), a morphologically highly diverse set of
Colletotrichum isolates are associated with diseased plants. There
are three GenBank accessions of Colletotrichum from cassava,
all from China, and although only ITS sequences are available for
these isolates, they appear to represent a single, distinct species
within the C. gloeosporioides complex. How these Chinese isolates
relate to cassava-associated isolates from other parts of the world
is not known.","Colletotrichum kahawae subsp. ciggaro B. Weir & P.R. Johnst., subsp. nov. MycoBank MB563758. Figs 26, 27. = Glomerella cingulata var. migrans Wollenw., Z. Parasitenk. (Berlin) 14: 262. 1949. = Glomerella rufomaculans var. vaccinii Shear, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club. 34: 314. 1907.

Etymology: Based on the title of the Jim Jarmusch movie “Coffee and Cigarettes”, referring to the close genetic relationship between C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro and the coffee pathogen C. kahawae subsp. kahawae; ciggaro is Portuguese for cigarette.

Holotype: Australia, on Olea europaea, coll. V. Sergeeva UWS124, 1989, PDD 102232; ex-type culture ICMP 18539. Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA 75–85 mm diam after 10 days for most isolates, the ex-holotype culture of G. cingulata var. migrans 48–49 mm diam. Aerial mycelium cottony, grey, dense, or in some isolates with dark stromatic masses and associated orange conidial ooze showing through mycelium from agar surface; in reverse agar with pinkish-orange pigments (6B4–7B4), irregular scattered black spots, and variable levels of development of overlying dark grey to green-grey pigments (4C2–5D4), these sometimes in discrete sectors.

Conidia form on dark-based acervuli, (12–)16–19.5(–29) × (4.5–)5(–8) μm (av. 17.8 × 5.1 μm, n = 214), cylindric, straight, apex rounded, often tapering slightly towards the base. Appressoria typically cylindric to fusoid in shape, deeply lobed. Perithecia numerous, forming tightly packed clumps, individual perithecia globose, small, about 250 μm diam, with a short ostiolar neck. Asci 55–100 × 10–12 μm, 8–spored. Ascospores (13.5–)17.5–20(–24) × (4–)4.5–5(–6.5) μm (av. 18.8 × 4.8 μm, n = 121), gently curved, tapering to quite narrow, rounded ends, widest point usually towards one end of the spore.

Geographic distribution and host range: Known from Australia, Germany, New Zealand, and South Africa. Both host and geographic range of the isolates we accept in C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro are broad.

Genetic identification: ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, TUB2, SOD2, and ITS sequences match those from C. kahawae subsp. kahawae. The two subspecies can be distinguished by GS sequences. Collectively, the two subspecies can be distinguished from all other species using ITS sequences alone.

Notes: The authentic isolate of G. cingulata var. migrans (CBS 237.49) differed from all other isolates we accept in C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro by its slower growth rate. Wollenweber & Hochapfel (1949) distinguished Glomerella cingulata var. migrans from G. cingulata var. cingulata on the basis of pathogenicity (G. cingulata var. migrans was pathogenic to Hypericum and not to apple) and because of its slightly longer ascospores and shorter conidia. We were unable to produce ascospores from CBS 237.49; the conidia were similar in size to those reported by Wollenweber & Hochapfel (1949), averaging 16.6 × 5.3 μm. However, the average ascospore and conidial lengths of our C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro isolates varied across the range cited by Wollenweber & Hochapfel (1949) for both G. cingulata var. cingulata and G. cingulata var. migrans.

Glomerella rufomaculans var. vaccinii was described by Shear (1907) for a fungus isolated from cranberry that was morphologically identical to isolates from apple and other hosts but appeared to be biologically distinct. A putatively authentic isolate of this species, deposited by Shear in CBS in 1922, matches C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro genetically.

Polashock et al. (2009) discussed the diversity of Colletotrichum, close match between their isolates and C. kahawae. Incorporation of their ITS sequences into our alignment confirms this. Whether there is a genetically distinct, cranberry-specialized taxon within C. kahawae requires additional genes to be sequenced from the cranberry-associated isolates.

Colletotrichum kahawae subsp. ciggaro was referred to as C. gloeosporioides Group B by Johnston & Jones (1997) and Johnston et al. (2005), and as Undescribed Group 1 by Silva et al. (2012b). Single ascospore isolates derived from perithecia forming in single conidial cultures of the avocado-associated isolates of C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro from New Zealand showed two highly divergent growth forms.

Geographic distribution and host range: Found in association with
fruit lesions of Musa spp. in many regions.
Genetic identification: ITS sequences separate C. musae from all
other species.
Notes: Colletotrichum musae was originally described from North
Carolina (Berkeley 1874), and the name was recently epitypified
by Su et al. (2011) on the basis of a specimen collected in Florida
(ex-epitype culture CBS 116870). Su et al. (2011) cite several
strains from Thailand that match their concept of C. musae, and
isolates from anthracnose symptoms on banana fruit from several
parts of the world are the same based on our study. These
isolates form a well-supported clade within the C. gloeosporioides
species complex, show low levels of genetic differentiation, and
based on ITS sequences are consistent with C. musae sensu
Sreenivasaprasad et al. (1996), Nirenberg et al. (2002) and Shenoy
et al. (2007). The morphology in culture agrees with the description
of Sutton & Waterston (1970).
We have not seen a Glomerella state in culture and none was
mentioned by Su et al. (2011). However, Rodriguez & Owen (1992)
reported rare production of perithecia from crosses between two
of 14 isolates identified as C. musae. It is not known whether the
isolates studied by Rodriguez & Owen (1992) match our concept of
C. musae genetically, but it is possible that this species behaves in a
similar way to some species in the C. acutatum complex, where the
sexual morph can be generated in culture under suitable conditions
(Guerber & Correll 2001). The name “Glomerella musae”, used by
Rodriguez & Owen (1992) and Krauss et al. (2001), has never been
validly published.
More than one species of Colletotrichum has been found
in association with rotting banana fruit. From isolates with well
characterised sequence data these include a species belonging to
C. acutatum s. lat. (Sherriff et al. 1994, Johnston & Jones 1997) that
is described as C. paxtonii (Damm et al. 2012a, this issue), and C.
karstii that belongs to the C. boninense species complex (Damm et
al. 2012b, this issue). The latter forms a sexual stage in culture and
is known from Musa in South America and Australia, as well as from
many other hosts worldwide, often as an endophyte. Species in the C.
boninense species complex have been previously confused with C.
gloeosporioides s. lat. Greene (1967) referred isolates pathogenic to
banana that were not associated with a teleomorph to C. musae, and
a second non-pathogenic species that formed fertile ascospores, to
C. gloeosporioides. Whether Glomerella musarum Petch, described
from leaves of banana and cited as the teleomorph of C. musae by
Sutton (1992) and Hyde et al. (2009), is a synonym of C. musae in
the sense we use the name here is not known, but seems unlikely
given the rare production of perithecia by this species.

Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA 58–63 mm diam
after 10 d, aerial mycelium dense, cottony to felted, uniform in
height, white to off-white; in reverse uniformly pale creamy yellow
(2A2–2A3) or in some cultures becoming dull greyish yellow (2D2–
2E2) towards the centre. No conidiogenous cells or conidia seen.
Geographic distribution and host range: Known from a single
isolate, from Psidium from Italy.
Genetic identification: Although known from only one isolate, ITS
sequences separate C. psidii from all other taxa.
Notes: A putatively authentic isolate of this species, deposited
in CBS by Curzi shortly after publication of C. psidii, represents
a genetically distinct species within the Kahawae clade. The only
available culture is stale, no longer forming conidia. Curzi (1927)
describes the conidia as 12–15 × 3.5–4.5 μm, cylindric with
rounded ends, straight or rarely slightly curved.
Anthracnose diseases have been noted for Psidium spp.
(guava) from several tropical regions of the world (e.g. MacCaughey
1917, Venkatakrishniah 1952, Liu 1972, Misra 2004). It is likely that
several Colletotrichum spp. are associated with guava fruit rots.
Whether the fungus described by Curzi from an Italian botanical
garden represents one of the species causing a guava disease in
the tropics is not known. All other members of the Kahawae clade
are predominantly tropical, so perhaps this fungus was introduced
to Italy along with its host plant. Misra (2004) uses C. psidii to refer
to a Colletotrichum species with curved conidia.
One other species has been described from this host,
Glomerella psidii (basionym Gloeosporium psidii), the relationship
of this species to C. psidii remains unknown. A new species on
Psidium guajava, C. guajavae, belonging to the C. acutatum
species complex, is described elsewhere in this volume (Damm
et al. 2012a).

this species was collected.

Epitype: Australia, Queensland, Brisbane, on Carica papaya, coll.
J.H. Simmonds 11663C, Sep. 1965, epitype here designated PDD
28797; ex-epitype culture ICMP 1778.
Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA 62–74 mm diam
after 10 d, aerial mycelium either dense, cottony, uniform, grey,
or with aerial mycelium lacking, towards centre of colony with
numerous, small acervuli with dark bases and orange conidial
ooze; in reverse cultures with copious aerial mycelium uniformly
dark grey (1F2), those with little aerial mycelium having a pinkish
brown (8B4) pigment within the agar, the dark bases of the acervuli
and the colour of the conidial ooze visible through the agar. Conidia
(12–)14.5–16.5(–21.5) × (3.5–)4.5–5(–6) μm (av. 15.5 × 4.8 μm, n
= 96), cylindric, straight, sometimes slightly constricted near centre,
ends broadly rounded. Appressoria about 6–12 μm diam., globose
to short-cylindric, rarely lobed. Perithecia not seen.
Geographic distribution and host range: Known from Carica papaya
and Persea americana from Queensland, Australia, and from
Coffea berries from Fiji. Simmonds (1965) reported from Australia
what he considered to be the same fungus also from Mangifera
indica, Malus sylvestris, and “many other hosts”.
Genetic identification: ITS sequences do not separate C.
queenslandicum from some C. fructicola, some C. siamense, and
some C. tropicale isolates. It is best distinguished from these taxa
using TUB2, GAPDH, or GS.
Notes: The ex-type cultures cited by Simmonds (1968) are no
longer in storage at BRIP in Queensland (R. Shivas, pers. comm.)
and presumably lost. However, we do have two cultures identified
as C. gloeosporioides var. minus by Simmonds and isolated from
the same host from the same locality as the holotype (Simmonds
isolates 16633C and 1647A2), that had been sent to Joan Dingley
in 1965 and subsequently stored in the ICMP culture collection.
The culture selected here as epitype (Simmonds 11663C = ICMP
1778) matches the Simmonds (1965) description of this fungus as
having “an abundance of aerial mycelium in culture”. Our conidial
measurements from ICMP 1778 and 1780 are broader than those
given by Simmonds (1965), but he does note that “Confusion can
occur between narrower strains of C. gloeosporioides and broader
strains of C. gloeosporioides var. minus …”. Simmonds (1965) also
notes that perithecia may rarely be seen in cultures of some isolates.
The isolates accepted here as C. queenslandicum are
genetically distinct within the Musae clade of C. gloeosporioides s.
lat. Colletotrichum minus Zimm. (1901) requires that we propose a
nom. nov. for this fungus at species rank.
Simmonds (1965) considered C. gloeosporioides var. minus
to be the conidial state of Glomerella cingulata var. minor
Wollenw. Wollenweber & Hochapfel (1949) used the name
Gloeosporium elasticae Cooke & Massee for the conidial state
of G. cingulata var. minor, the type specimens for both names
being from Ficus. Simmonds (1965) noted that it was not possible
to transfer G. elasticae to Colletotrichum because Colletotrichum
elasticae had already been published for a different fungus.
However, rather than proposing a nom. nov. for Gloeosporium
elasticae, he described C. gloeosporioides var. minus as a new
variety, with a different type specimen. Glomerella cingulata var.
minor is genetically distinct from the specimen Simmonds chose
as the type of C. gloeosporioides var. minus, see notes under G.

limited set of isolates within the C. gloeosporioides complex, making
interpretation of the genetic differences difficult. The morphological
differences they described are commonly seen as within-species
variation in other Colletotrichum spp. In our analysis, C. siamense is
represented by 30 isolates from a wide range of hosts from several
tropical regions, and forms a monophyletic clade that cannot be
further subdivided genetically. Variation in cultural appearance is
broad but in part this probably reflects the different conditions under
which the isolates had been stored. Shape and size of appressoria,
and the characteristically small conidia are similar in all isolates.
Based on matching translation elongation factor (TEF) and
TUB2 sequences, isolates referred by Rojas et al. (2010) to
Colletotrichum sp. indet. 2 also represent C. siamense. Note that
TEF data was excluded from our phylogenetic analyses because
the TEF gene tree was often incongruent with the trees from the
other genes that we sequenced. For example, compare our isolate
ICMP 17797 (GenBank GU174571) with isolates Rojas et al. (2010)
cite as Colletotrichum sp. indet. 2, V1H1_1 (GenBank GU994297)
and 7767 (GenBank GU994298).

Descriptions of Colletotrichum siamense indicate that it was originally described from coffee in Thailand, but it is now recognized as biologically and geographically diverse, found on various hosts across tropical and subtropical regions.

Genetic identification of C. siamense shows that ITS sequences do not reliably separate it from C. alienum, C. fructicola, or C. tropicale. These species are better distinguished using CAL or TUB2 markers. Studies have noted genetic and morphological differences between C. siamense, C. jasmini-sambac, and C. hymenocallidis. However, the limited set of isolates used in these studies makes it difficult to interpret genetic differences. The morphological traits described are often viewed as within-species variation in other Colletotrichum species.

In our analysis, C. siamense is represented by 30 isolates from a wide range of hosts across several tropical regions, forming a monophyletic clade that cannot be further subdivided genetically. While there is considerable variation in cultural appearance, this is likely due to the different conditions under which the isolates were stored. The shape and size of appressoria and the characteristically small conidia are consistent across all isolates.

Additionally, isolates previously referred to as Colletotrichum sp. indet. 2 also represent C. siamense based on matching translation elongation factor (TEF) and TUB2 sequences. However, TEF data was excluded from phylogenetic analyses because it often conflicted with trees from other sequenced genes.

The C. siamense protologue designates the holotype as MFLU 090230, but the culture derived from the holotype is labeled “BCC” with no specimen number. The ex-holotype culture is listed in previous work, and strain BDP-I2, obtained for this study, is deposited as ICMP 18578.

Rojas et al. (2010), and Munaut et al. (2002) respectively, belong in
a clade that we accept genetically as a single species. Also in this
clade are authentic isolates of C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis
“f. sp. stylosanthis” and C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis “f. sp.
guianensis” (but see notes under C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis).
Colletotrichum theobromicola as accepted here contains
several putatively specialised pathogens, including the pathogen of
strawberry runners described by Brooks (1931) as C. fragariae, and
the pathogens of Stylosanthes referred to as C. gloeosporioides f.
stylosanthis (Munaut et al. 2002). Future studies may show that
the species should be segregated based on their pathogenicity
to specific hosts. See also notes under C. fragariae and C.
gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis.
Munaut et al. (2002) distinguished C. gloeosporioides f.
stylosanthis from isolates they considered to represent C.
gloeosporioides f. gloeosporioides because of 2 additional C’s at
positions 93 and 94 in the ITS1 region, giving a string of 7 C’s at
this position. This characteristic feature of the ITS-1 is found also in
the ex-neotype isolate of C. theobromicola, the ex-epitype isolate
of C. fragariae and all other isolates of C. theobromicola, although
a few isolates have 3 additional C’s rather than 2. None of the
other isolates that we sampled from the C. gloeosporioides species
complex have this characteristic string of C’s.
Rojas et al. (2010) provide a description for their concept of
C. theobromicola, MacKenzie et al. (2008) for C. fragariae, and
Irwin & Cameron (1978) for C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis “f. sp.
stylosanthis” (as C. gloeosporioides Type A) and C. gloeosporioides
f. stylosanthis “f. sp. guianensis” (as C. gloeosporioides Type B).
In cultural appearance the isolates we accept in this species are
variable, from the very dark ex-neotype isolate of C. theobromicola
to the slow-growing, pale coloured C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis
“f. sp. guianensis”. None of the isolates that we examined formed
perithecia in culture. All had conidia tapering slightly towards
each end, this more pronounced towards the base, matching
the description of C. fragariae by Gunnell & Gubler (1992), who
regarded the conidial shape as distinctive for the species. Some
of the isolates studied by Gunnell & Gubler (1992) were included
in the study of MacKenzie et al. (2008), their genetic concept of C.
fragariae matching ours.

Geographically, C. theobromicola is broadly distributed in tropical and subtropical regions, affecting a wide range of hosts. Genetic identification using ITS sequences successfully distinguishes C. theobromicola from other species.

Notably, the ex-epitype culture of C. fragariae, the ex-neotype culture of C. theobromicola, and the ex-holotype culture of C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis are part of a genetically accepted clade representing a single species. This clade also includes authentic isolates of C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis “f. sp. stylosanthis” and “f. sp. guianensis.” C. theobromicola is thought to encompass several specialized pathogens, including those affecting strawberry runners and Stylosanthes, with future studies likely to further refine these classifications based on host specificity.

Munaut et al. distinguished C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis by identifying two additional cytosines in the ITS1 region. This feature is also present in the ex-neotype isolate of C. theobromicola and all other isolates of C. theobromicola, although a few have three additional cytosines. No other isolates sampled from the C. gloeosporioides complex exhibit this characteristic.

The cultural appearance of accepted isolates varies widely, from the very dark ex-neotype isolate of C. theobromicola to the pale, slow-growing C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis “f. sp. guianensis.” None of the examined isolates formed perithecia in culture, and all had conidia that tapered slightly towards each end, consistent with the description of C. fragariae.

328,"The species that we accept in the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides
species complex together form a strongly supported clade in the
Colletotrichum ITS gene tree (fig. 1 in Cannon et al. 2012, this issue).
All species are micro-morphologically typical of C. gloeosporioides
sensu von Arx (1970) and Sutton (1992). However, morphology
alone cannot unequivocally place an isolate in this complex,
making the ITS particularly important for identification at the
species complex level in Colletotrichum. For example, members of
the C. boninense species complex (Damm et al. 2012b, this issue)
and C. cliviae (Yang et al. 2009) are micro-morphologically similar
to species in the C. gloeosporioides complex but genetically distinct
(Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). The utility of ITS sequences is
enhanced by their strong representation in GenBank, but this can
also be a problem. Nilsson et al. (2006) summarised the frequency
of inaccurately annotated data in GenBank. The diversity of
taxonomic concepts around the name C. gloeosporioides makes
this a particular problem. This is illustrated by the phylogeny
presented by Hyde et al. (2010), based on GenBank accessions
of ITS sequences identified as C. gloeosporioides and Glomerella
cingulata, that shows the taxa represented belong to many species

specific examples of misidentified GenBank accessions.","The species accepted within the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex form a strongly supported clade in the Colletotrichum ITS gene tree. All species are micro-morphologically typical of C. gloeosporioides as described by von Arx and Sutton. However, morphology alone cannot definitively place an isolate in this complex, making ITS sequences particularly important for identification at the species complex level in Colletotrichum. For instance, members of the C. boninense species complex and C. cliviae are micro-morphologically similar to species in the C. gloeosporioides complex but are genetically distinct.

The utility of ITS sequences is enhanced by their strong representation in GenBank; however, this can also present challenges. Inaccurately annotated data in GenBank is a known issue, as highlighted by previous studies. The diversity of taxonomic concepts surrounding the name C. gloeosporioides exacerbates this problem. This is illustrated by phylogenetic analyses showing that accessions identified as C. gloeosporioides and Glomerella cingulata belong to many species across different Colletotrichum species complexes. Specific examples of misidentified GenBank accessions can be found under C. boehmeriae, C. crassipes, and C. kahawae subsp. kahawae.","What challenges arise from the reliance on ITS sequences for the identification of species within the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex, particularly in relation to misidentifications in GenBank?",How do the morphological characteristics of species in the C. boninense and C. cliviae complexes complicate their classification in relation to the C. gloeosporioides complex?,"In what ways do phylogenetic analyses illustrate the diversity and complexity of the Colletotrichum species complexes, particularly regarding the names associated with C. gloeosporioides and Glomerella cingulata?",Are all species within the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex micro-morphologically typical of C. gloeosporioides?,Is the identification of Colletotrichum species solely based on morphology sufficient for accurate classification?,Are there known issues with inaccurately annotated data in GenBank that affect the identification of Colletotrichum species?,The Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex.pdf
329,"The species we accept are based on a phylogenetic species
concept, all species forming strongly supported, monophyletic
clades within our multigene phylogenies. However, not all terminal
clades are recognised as named species. In most cases any well
supported, within-species phylogenetic structure evident in the
multi-gene phylogeny is not resolved consistently in all gene trees.
This lack of congruence between gene trees is a signal that the
diversity being sampled is below the species level, according to
the logic of the genealogical concordance phylogenetic species
recognition (GCPSR) concept (Taylor et al. 2000). Although the
concatenation of gene sequences is a convenient way to present
multigene data, it masks discordance between individual gene
phylogenies. An alternative method, using a species-tree approach
(Figs 3, 4B, 5B) combines multi-gene data from multiple isolates
hypothesised to represent a single species, so that the evolutionary
history of the species rather than that of individual isolates is
estimated. Fig. 3, shows the results of such an analysis for the C.
gloeosporioides complex, Figs 4B and 5B show relationships within
the Musae and Kahawae clades respectively, at an expanded
scale. Posterior probabilities for some of the speciation events
are low, particularly within the Musae and Kahawae clades. This
may be because although the species-trees algorithms account
for incomplete lineage sorting (Heled & Drummond 2010, Chung
& Ané 2011), most do not compensate for horizontal gene transfer,
reassortment, or introgression. Hybridisation could also result
in discordant gene phylogenies. Hybrids are known in the C.
acutatum complex, e.g. Glomerella acutata, a hybrid formed by
crossing C. acutatum and C. fioriniae strains in the laboratory,
and a putative hybrid strain between the same two species that
had been collected from terminal crook disease on Pinus in New
Zealand, where both species occur in nature (Damm et al. 2012a,
this issue). Hybrids also form in the C. gloeosporioides complex,
e.g. the Carya and Aeschynomene populations discussed by Cisar
et al. (1994), more or less genetically equivalent to our species
within the C. gloeosporioides complex.","The species accepted in this study are based on a phylogenetic species concept, with all species forming strongly supported, monophyletic clades within our multigene phylogenies. However, not all terminal clades are recognized as named species.

This lack of congruence signals that the diversity being sampled is likely below the species level, in line with the genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition (GCPSR) concept.

While concatenating gene sequences presents a convenient overview of multigene data, it can mask discordance between individual gene phylogenies. An alternative method involves a species-tree approach that combines multi-gene data from multiple isolates hypothesized to represent a single species. This allows estimation of the evolutionary history of the species rather than that of individual isolates. Results of such analyses for the C. gloeosporioides complex are illustrated, with specific relationships shown for the Musae and Kahawae clades at an expanded scale.

low levels of genetic divergence across the C. gloeosporioides

that were used in this study could be proposed as a secondary
barcode to obtain an accurate identification of species within the
C. gloeosporioides complex. A preliminary analysis of the genes
performance as barcodes was conducted as part of Cai et al.
(2009) with GAPDH, CAL, and ACT performing well, but CHS-
1, ITS, and TEF (EF1α) poorly. However, the analysis (Cai et al.
2009) included only five species within the C. gloeosporioides
complex, the Musae and Kahawae clades being treated at the level
of species. With the final classification presented here, none of
the genes we analysed provides an effective barcode ont its own
across the entire complex. Of the single genes, TUB2, GS, and
GAPDH are amongst the most effective at distinguishing species.

GS sequences are needed to distinguish C. fructicola and C.
alienum. With GS, C. aotearoa, C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, and C.
siamense are paraphyletic. GAPDH is the easiest of all the genes
tested to amplify and sequence, however when using this gene GS
sequences are needed to distinguish C. fructicola from C. alienum
and C. aeschynomenes from C. siamense, and C. tropicale is
paraphyletic. In the species descriptions we provide notes on which
genes are the best for genetic identifications, and in Table 4 these
are summarised for all species and genes. For species represented
by a single or only a few isolates the species boundaries may not
be accurate, we recommend two protein-coding genes in addition
to ITS for sequence-based identifications. A meta-analysis of
DNA barcodes across the whole genus will be required to find the
combination of genes that are effective for all species of the genus

340,"Despite the epitypification of C. gloeosporioides in 2008, web
search hits on the name C. gloeosporioides from papers published
over the past 12 mo show that many authors will continue to use
the name in the sense of the C. gloeosporioides species complex,
presumably regarding this level of identification as sufficient for their
research. All of the isolates that we accept in the C. gloeosporioides
complex share the string 5’–GGGCGGGT–3’ about 139–142 bases
after the ITS1F primer binding site. Based on a comparison with
GenBank data, this string appears to be specific to isolates that
we would accept as members of the C. gloeosporioides complex.
Several authors have developed PCR-based, rapid identification
tools for distinguishing members of the C. gloeosporioides complex
from members of the C. acutatum species complex. This has been
prompted because some members of the C. acutatum complex
have conidia without the acute ends characteristic of this species as
described by Simmonds (1965), and have at times been confused
with C. gloeosporioides (Damm et al. 2012, this issue). Primers
reportedly specific to C. gloeosporioides include the CgInt primer for
ITS (Mills et al. 1992). In our data set this primer sequence is found
in C. gloeosporioides s. str., C. fructicola, and C. siamense but all
of the other taxa that we recognise within the C. gloeosporioides
complex have one or more bases not matching the CgInt primer.
The practical impact of these differences will depend in part on
the position of the mismatch and stringency of the PCR reaction.
Talhinas et al. (2005) discussed the TBCG primer for β-tubulin,
and this is found within all of our taxa within the C. gloeosporioides
group except C. musae and C. asianum. Liu et al. (2011) describe
characteristic RFLP bands from glutamine synthetase using the
restriction enzyme Pst1. Based on our sequences, this method will
generate the characteristic C. gloeosporioides bands reported by Liu
et al. (2011) for C. aenigma, C. alienum, C. aotearoa, C. asianum,
C. clidemiae, C. cordylinicola, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides s.

(band sizes 51, 112, 337, 457), and C. musae (band sizes 388,

authors.","Despite the epitypification of C. gloeosporioides in 2008, web search hits on the name C. gloeosporioides from papers published over the past 12 months show that many authors continue to use the name in the context of the C. gloeosporioides species complex, presumably regarding this level of identification as sufficient for their research.

are ovate or sometimes clavate","Conidial and mycelial appressoria (also referred to as hyphopodia) are commonly described in Colletotrichum species. Sutton characterized the mycelial appressoria formed in potato-carrot agar (PCA) using a slide culture technique, while others have utilized PDA with incubation in the dark or observed mycelial appressoria on the undersurface of SNA cultures. Conidial appressoria have been recorded when conidia are germinated in drops of deionised water on plastic cover slips in a moist chamber. Although conidial appressoria are taxonomically uninformative and of limited use for species diagnosis, it has been noted that the shape of appressoria can differentiate C. acutatum (which has relatively smooth appressoria) from C. gloeosporioides (which has more lobed appressoria). Additionally, appressoria shape and size have proven useful for delimiting grass-associated Colletotrichum species, though they should be considered alongside host range. Conidial appressoria can distinguish two species of Colletotrichum from Amaryllidaceae, with the conidial appressoria of C. hippeastri being larger than those of C. hymenocallidis, and displaying irregular, crenate, or lobed forms, occasionally becoming complex.

confusion to the end user; sequence

371,"Pathogenicity testing
It is important to establish whether a
particular Colletotrichum species is hostspecific
or has a wide host range. Host-specific
taxa may have a limited distribution, which
may have important biosecurity implications. If
the taxon has a wide host range the species is
likely to be cosmopolitan and possibly an
opportunistic pathogen. Host range studies may
provide data useful in classification and future
delimitation of species. Koch’s postulates have
been completed to confirm the pathogenicity of
various Colletotrichum isolates. For example,
Vinnere et al. (2002) showed that Rhododendron
anthracnose was caused by C. acutatum;
Lee et al. (2005) re-infected Euonymus leaves
with C. boninense in moist chamber pathogenicity
tests; Tomioka et al. (2008) showed that a
species referred to as C. dematium (but see
Damm et al., 2009) was the causal agent of
severe spotting, blight and drop of leaves of
Polygonatum falcatum. Descriptions of new
species sometimes include data on pathogenicity
testing (Nakamura et al., 2006; Moriwaki
and Tsukiboshi 2009; Yang et al., 2009),
although this is not usually the case (e.g. Farr
et al., 2006). Crouch et al. (2009c) confirmed
that a new species, C. navitas, caused anthracnose
of Panicum virgatum. Much of the
pathogenicity work that has been carried out
needs repeating with verified Colletotrichum
species. For example, pathogenicity tests using
C. acutatum, C. capsici and C. gloeosporioides
isolates from chili were carried out on
susceptible and resistant varieties of chili (Than
et al., 2008b) but names of the Colletotrichum
species used need to be re-examined in light of
a re-assessment of some of these Colletotrichum
species (Shivas and Tan, 2009). Papers
epitypifying plant pathogenic taxa should
ideally include pathogenicity testing, but this
has not usually been done (e.g. Shenoy et al.,
2007; Cannon et al., 2008; Than et al., 2008a;

372,"Cross mating experiments
A cross mating test is an in vitro
experiment employed to recognise fungal
species based on the biological species concept
(Mayr, 1940; Taylor et al., 2000). In biological
species recognition, groups of mating compatible
individuals are regarded as the same
species (Taylor et al., 2000). There are major
obstacles that limit the application of this
theory to fungi including: 1) many fungi are
asexual (they may have permanently lost the
ability to reproduce sexually) and do not
produce ascospores (Reynolds, 1993); 2) some
species are able to produce ascospores without
a partner (homothallic), e.g. C. falcatum and C.
graminicola (von Arx and Müller, 1954; Politis,
1975; Vaillancourt and Hanaui, 1991); 3)
failure of some heterothallic fungi to mate in
artificial cultivation; and 4) there is much
evidence that groups of genetically isolated
fungi may retain the ancestral characters of
interbreeding. A common result is that mating
tests may define species that encompass more
than one genetically and phylogenetically isolated
groups (Perkins and Turner, 1988; Chase
and Ullrich, 1990; Vilgalys and Sun, 1994;

and chemotype were recently used in a
polyphasic approach to clarify the taxonomic
status of Colletotrichum isolates associated
with anthracnose disease of yam (Dioscorea

of C. gloeosporioides sensu lato were recognised
associated with foliar anthracnose of yam:
slow growing grey (SGG); fast growing salmon
(FGS); fast-growing grey (FGG); and fast
growing olive (FGO). The FGG morphotype

three morphotypes based on ITS sequence data.

the original host, B) from the original
geographic locality and C) have well
matched morphology and other phenotypic
characters as the type which should be
examined if available and preferentially
illustrated. When an epitype is designated,
the holotype, lectotype, or neotype that the
epitype supports must be explicitly cited
(Mcneill et al., 2006).
8. Pathogenicity testing may be useful and
should be carried out where possible.","Protocols for describing new species and epitypes:

A detailed morphological description of the fungus should be provided (e.g., Colletotrichum fructicola by Prihastuti, L. Cai & K.D. Hyde, and C. anthrisci by Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous).
In addition to any distinctive morphological or polyphasic characters, the proposed new species should show sufficient evolutionary divergence from closely related taxa based on multiple gene sequence analyses, with comparisons made to type specimens.
Multiple gene loci, such as ITS, TUB2, GPDH, and ACT, should be characterized, and sequences deposited in a recognized international database.
Media used for descriptions and comparisons should follow recommendations from this paper, and where possible, a description should be provided from a collection on host tissues.
Ex-type cultures of any new Colletotrichum species should be deposited in at least two internationally recognized culture collections, and all information registered in MycoBank.
Details of growth rate on standard media at standard temperatures and conditions should be included.
When selecting a specimen and derived culture to serve as epitype and ex-epitype, three rules should be considered (McNeill et al., 2006): A) it should come from the original host, B) from the original geographic locality, and C) have well-matched morphology and phenotypic characters to the type, which should be examined and preferably illustrated. The holotype, lectotype, or neotype the epitype supports must be explicitly cited.
Pathogenicity testing should be carried out where possible and may prove useful.",What are the key characteristics that differentiate a proposed new species of fungus from closely related taxa?,Why is it important to deposit sequences in an international database when describing new fungal species?,What are the criteria for selecting a specimen to serve as an epitype?,Should multiple gene loci be characterized when describing a new fungus species?,Is it recommended to include details about the growth rate of the fungus in standard conditions?,Should ex-type cultures be deposited in at least two internationally recognized culture collections?,A polyphasic approach for studying Colletotrichum.pdf

by Dan Legard during the 2005 Austin workshop; it is noteworthy that about two-thirds of the total plant
supply is for short-day cultivars and one-third is for day-neutrals (cold-stored and fresh-dug). This
calculation of the day-neutral plant requirement is derived from information in Sjulin (2007)which indicates
that 65 million cold-stored day-neutral cultivars are produced by California nurseries for fruit plantings
along the southern California coast (requiring about 65,000 plants/ha, or 26,300 plants per acre), and about
160 million fresh-dug plants of day-neutral cultivars are needed to annually supply the Watsonville/Salinas

459,"Another troubling implication of the
research by Leandro. A second troubling
dimension of the research by Leandro et al.
(2001) was identified by Stanley Freeman,
who sees the formation of secondary conidia
on strawberry leaves without penetration as a
‘‘mechanism that enables the pathogen to
survive and proliferate on the different host
and non-host leaf surfaces’’ (Freeman, 2007).
This brings into question our knowledge of
the host range and specificity of C. acutatum
obtained from strawberry plants (Freeman,
2007; Sjulin, 2007; Smith, 2007). It may also
be important to rethink whether susceptible
hosts are the only way this disease can be
moved around, and there may be value in
looking at nonplant surfaces as well.",,What implications does the formation of secondary conidia have for understanding pathogen survival?,How might the findings challenge existing knowledge about the host range of C. acutatum?,What potential avenues for disease transmission are suggested by this research?,Does the research by Leandro raise concerns about the host specificity of C. acutatum?,Is there a possibility that non-plant surfaces contribute to the spread of the disease?,Should researchers reconsider the traditional view of disease transmission through only susceptible hosts?,"Anthracnose on Strawberry Its Etiology, Epidemiology, and Pathology, Together with Management Strategies for Strawberry Nurseries Introduction to the Workshop.pdf"
460,"In reference to the question about how the
pathogen is gaining entrance to the plant
production system, it is known that C. acutatum
has a wide host range, but it is not clear
whether it comes into the system from alternate
hosts. Surveys are needed to determine
if the pathogen occurs in the vicinity of
nursery production. Sjulin (2007) reviews
the more recent research of special concern
to the California nursery industry regarding
outbreaks of C. acutatum on almonds and
highbush blueberry, but to date, he concludes
that ‘‘isolates of C. acutatum commonly
found on strawberry seem to be distinct from
isolates on most other crops except cultivated
anemone (Anemone coronaria L.), and there
is little evidence of cross-infection except
from anemone.’’",,What methods can be used to survey for C. acutatum in nursery production?,How does the host range of C. acutatum affect its transmission?,What implications might the distinct isolates of C. acutatum have for crop management?,Is it clear whether C. acutatum enters the system from alternate hosts?,Have outbreaks of C. acutatum been documented on highbush blueberry?,Is there evidence of cross-infection between strawberry and other crops?,"Anthracnose on Strawberry Its Etiology, Epidemiology, and Pathology, Together with Management Strategies for Strawberry Nurseries Introduction to the Workshop.pdf"
461,"In her paper, ‘‘Epidemiology and Pathology
of Strawberry Anthracnose: A North
American Perspective,’’ Barbara Smith
tested the hypothesis that primary infection
in strawberry (fruit) fields is sometimes
assumed to come from other host crops (other
fruit or vegetable hosts) growing near the
strawberry field, but her findings did not
suggest that primary anthracnose infections
in strawberry fields are rarely from other
diseased fruit or vegetable hosts and are most
often from infected strawberry transplants.",,What are the common sources of primary anthracnose infections in strawberry fields according to Barbara Smith's findings?,How does the presence of nearby fruit or vegetable crops affect the infection rates of anthracnose in strawberries?,What hypothesis was Barbara Smith testing regarding the transmission of anthracnose in strawberry fields?,Did Barbara Smith find that primary anthracnose infections in strawberries often come from nearby diseased crops?,Is the primary source of anthracnose infections in strawberry fields usually infected strawberry transplants?,Was the hypothesis about other host crops being the primary source of infection supported by Smith's findings?,"Anthracnose on Strawberry Its Etiology, Epidemiology, and Pathology, Together with Management Strategies for Strawberry Nurseries Introduction to the Workshop.pdf"
462,"However, Freeman (2007) points out that
C. acutatum from strawberry can survive on
several cultivated plant species, such as
pepper, eggplant, tomato, bean, and weed
species, without causing disease symptoms,
and he raises the possibility that alternate
hosts can serve as a potential inoculum
reservoir for strawberry infection between
seasons. Further research in North American
nursery production areas that have had a past
history of C. acutatum outbreaks will better
determine whether there is potential crossinfection
issue with alternate hosts. Dale et al.
(2007) reinforce the points made by Freeman
(2007) and Sjulin (2007), that healthy nursery
stock plants must be separated from field
edges to avoid contamination from wild or
weedy hosts.",,What role do alternate hosts play in the life cycle of C. acutatum?,How might nursery production practices change to mitigate cross-infection risks?,What specific methods could be used to separate healthy nursery stock from potential contaminating hosts?,Can C. acutatum survive on plant species other than strawberries?,Has there been previous research on C. acutatum outbreaks in North American nurseries?,Should nursery stock plants be kept away from field edges to prevent contamination?,"Anthracnose on Strawberry Its Etiology, Epidemiology, and Pathology, Together with Management Strategies for Strawberry Nurseries Introduction to the Workshop.pdf"

479,"It is very challenging to breed strawberry

problem may relate to a high level of diversity

2003), but when an intensive seedling screening
is applied for crown rot resistance, and
seedling populations are segregated for fruit
rot resistance, it is possible to achieve resistant
strawberry cultivars, such as Pelican,
which is resistant to both fruit and crown
rot (Smith et al., 1998). Planting resistant

susceptible cultivars (e.g., Strawberry
Festival) or highly susceptible cultivars (e.g.,

applications of fungicides are often needed to
suppress the AFR (Mertely and Peres, 2005).

483,"Abstract: To improve phylogenetic resolution of the
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex we
developed and tested the performance of a new set
of primers for the Apn2/MAT locus with a case study
of 22 isolates. These were isolated mainly from coffee
plants and represent six divergent and well characterized
species within the C. gloeosporioides complex.
Following previous studies on this locus, we have
generated sequence data from an expanded region
(. 4600 bp), revealing increased phylogenetic
informativeness when compared to other commonly
used markers such as ITS, b-tub2 and GS. Within the
Apn2/MAT locus the ApMAT marker alone was
almost as informative in terms of phylogenetic
resolution as a seven-gene concatenated dataset.
Our results further revealed that gene-tree discordance
may come to be a common issue in resolving
evolutionary relationships in the C. gloeosporioides
complex, highlighting the importance of multilocus
approaches. The use of state-of-the-art data analysis
techniques and a highly informative dataset as
employed here may abate this issue and hopefully
assist in disentangling the C. gloeosporioides complex.

484,"Disentangling species complexes in the Colletotrichum
genus will remain a considerable challenge for taxonomists
in the years to come. Given the worldwide
importance of this genus, mainly comprising plant
pathogens, it is essential to accurately identify species
and/or pathotypes to improve biosecurity and disease
control (Johnston and Jones 1997, Freeman et al.
1998, Cai et al. 2009). Morphological, cultural and
host-preference criteria have been the primary basis
for species identification and delimitation. However,
due to the unreliability and limited number of those
diagnostic characteristics, studies based on such
criteria have led to longstanding and unresolved
taxonomic issues (Cannon et al. 2000, Afanador-
Kafuri et al. 2002, Du et al. 2005, Hyde et al. 2009a).
As Sutton (1992) stated, morphology alone is unlikely
to provide enough information to improve systematics
of species complexes, such as C. gloeosporioides
(e.g. the graminicolous group, Du et al. 2005; the
curved spore/dematium group, Damm et al. 2009).","Disentangling species complexes within the Colletotrichum genus will continue to pose a significant challenge for taxonomists in the coming years. Given the global importance of this genus, which primarily consists of plant pathogens, accurately identifying species and/or pathotypes is essential for improving biosecurity and disease management (Johnston and Jones 1997; Freeman et al. 1998; Cai et al. 2009).
Traditionally, species identification and delimitation have relied on morphological, cultural, and host-preference criteria. However, these diagnostic characteristics often prove unreliable and limited, resulting in longstanding and unresolved taxonomic issues (Cannon et al. 2000; Afanador-Kafuri et al. 2002; Du et al. 2005; Hyde et al. 2009a). As noted by Sutton (1992), morphology alone is insufficient to enhance the systematics of species complexes, such as C. gloeosporioides, including groups like the graminicolous group (Du et al. 2005) and the curved spore/dematium group (Damm et al. 2009).",What challenges do taxonomists face when studying the Colletotrichum genus?,Why is accurate identification of Colletotrichum species important for agriculture?,What limitations are associated with traditional methods of species identification in this genus?,Is the Colletotrichum genus primarily composed of plant pathogens?,Have morphological criteria been deemed reliable for species identification in Colletotrichum?,Did Sutton suggest that morphology alone is sufficient for improving systematics in species complexes?,Application of the Apn2MAT locus to improve the systematics of the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex.pdf
485,"C. gloeosporioides is regarded as the most challenging
species complex to resolve, comprising the
broadest host range of all Colletotrichum species (Du
et al. 2005). Fungal strains from this complex have
been reported from at least 1800 plant hosts and
present such a wide range of morphological and pathogenic
variation that the species name is of limited
practical use (Hyde et al. 2009a). A major contribution
for the enlargement of this complex was the
revision of the genus by von Arx (1957) in which a
wider spore range was established as a criterion for C.
gloeosporioides identification (Sutton 1992). As a result,
many Colletotrichum strains with similar cylindrical
conidia were identified as C. gloeosporioides, lumping
together potentially distinct taxa (Hindorf et al. 1970,
Munaut et al. 1998, Freeman et al. 2000, Chakraborty
et al. 2002, Xiao et al. 2004, Hyde et al. 2009b). Since
the revision by Sutton (1992) until the most recent
major revision of the genus (Hyde et al. 2009a) most
studies on C. gloeosporioides systematics (e.g. Abang
et al. 2002, Lubbe et al. 2004, Xiao et al. 2004, Suzuki et
al. 2010) addressed only specific hosts, often reclassifying
isolates previously described as C. gloeosporioides
into other Colletotrichum species (e.g. Gunnel and
Gubler 1992, Sreenivasaprasad et al. 1994, Ramos et al.
2006). In fact, the exceptionally broad host range of C.
gloeosporiodes hampers studies addressing the entire
complex.","C. gloeosporioides is regarded as the most challenging species complex to resolve, comprising the broadest host range of all Colletotrichum species.

since, the availability of living ex-type strains and
sequence data has provided a solid reference basis to
which isolates can be compared. However, the criteria
for species delimitation have been subject of much
debate throughout the years and Colletotrichum has
been an example (Cannon et al. 2008). Until recently,
single-locus phylogenies dominated molecular
systematics of the C. gloeosporioides complex, despite
their limited resolving ability (Sreenivasaprasad et al.
1993, 1996; Johnston and Jones 1997, Nguyen et al.

transcribed spacers (ITS) flanking the 5.8 S ribosomal
RNA is the most widely sequenced region in Colletotrichum
phylogenetic studies. Consequently, ITS-based
C. gloeosporioides-specific primers (Mills et al. 1992)
have been widely used for identification of Colletotrichum
fungi over the past 10–15 y. However there are
serious concerns about the resolving power of ITS for
closely related species (Cai et al. 2009, Crouch et al.

512,"DISCUSSION
Resolving species complexes in Colletotrichum, particularly
the C. gloeosporioides complex, is a demanding
quest in which molecular systematic tools
are becoming of the utmost importance for taxonomists.
However, genomic regions are not equally
informative and thus it is important to select the most
useful loci to address this issue. The MAT locus has
been employed with great success in phylogenetic
studies of Colletotrichum (Du et al. 2005; Crouch et al.
2006, 2009a; Rojas et al. 2010) as well as in other
genera, such as Cochliobolus (Turgeon 1998), Fusarium
(O’Donnell et al. 2004) and Leptosphaeria (Voigt
et al. 2005). In our work a newly developed set of
primers enabled the analysis of an expanded region
of the Apn2/MAT locus in relation to other studies
exploring this locus (Du et al. 2005, Crouch et al.
2009a, Rojas et al. 2010). In fact, our primer sets were
able to generate not only orthologous sequences to
those already published (e.g. the 39 end of the Apn2
gene and intergenic region between MAT1-2-1
[Crouch et al. 2009a, Rojas et al. 2010] or the intron
in the HMG region of the MAT1-2-1 gene [Du et al.
2005]) but also the remainder of the Apn2 gene
sequence as well as the complete MAT1-2-1 gene
along with a portion of the 59 intergenic region, covering
, 2700 bp of novel sequence data from this locus.
Overall, our analyses further demonstrated the potential

in phylogenetic informativeness to face the
taxonomic challenges of the C. gloeosporioides complex.","DISCUSSION
 Resolving species complexes in Colletotrichum, particularly the C. gloeosporioides complex, is a demanding quest in which molecular systematic tools are becoming increasingly important for taxonomists. However, genomic regions are not equally informative, making it crucial to select the most useful loci for this purpose. The MAT locus has been employed successfully in phylogenetic studies of Colletotrichum, as well as in other genera such as Cochliobolus, Fusarium, and Leptosphaeria. In our work, a newly developed set of primers enabled the analysis of an expanded region of the Apn2/MAT locus, building on previous studies exploring this locus. Our primer sets were able to generate not only orthologous sequences to those already published (e.g., the 39 end of the Apn2 gene and the intergenic region between MAT1-2-1, or the intron in the HMG region of the MAT1-2-1 gene) but also the remainder of the Apn2 gene sequence and the complete MAT1-2-1 gene along with a portion of the 59 intergenic region, covering approximately 2,700 bp of novel sequence data from this locus. Overall, our analyses further demonstrated the potential of this genomic region to significantly improve phylogenetic informativeness in addressing the taxonomic challenges of the C. gloeosporioides complex.",What challenges do taxonomists face when resolving species complexes in Colletotrichum?,How does the MAT locus contribute to phylogenetic studies in fungi?,What advancements have been made in the analysis of the Apn2/MAT locus compared to previous studies?,Is the MAT locus considered useful for phylogenetic studies in Colletotrichum?,Did the newly developed primers provide more sequence data than previously published studies?,Are molecular systematic tools becoming increasingly important for taxonomists studying species complexes?,Application of the Apn2MAT locus to improve the systematics of the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex.pdf

516,"Regarding their informative potential, all newly
developed primer pairs generated sequences that
were superior to ITS and to the two commonly used
gene fragments, b-tub2 and GS, even though the
latter had been useful and regarded as fairly
informative (Talhinhas et al. 2005, Prihastuti et al.
2009, Rojas et al. 2010). The ITS sequence in
particular, which is considered one of the most
promising regions for fungal barcoding (Seifert
2009), performed poorly in our benchmark comparisons,
being unable to distinguish taxonomic groups
and recover their relationships. This also has been
observed in other studies (Cai et al. 2009, Crouch
et al. 2009b, Yang et al. 2009). As evidenced by the
sliding window analysis of polymorphism and parsimony
statistics, the intergenic region between the
Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 genes was revealed to be the
most variable segment and thus a promising marker
for both taxonomic and population genetic studies in
the complex. Intergenic regions are expected to be
much more variable because they generally are not
under functional constraints or any direct selective
pressures (O’Donnell et al. 2004, Thomson et al.
2010), but for the same reason they are unsuitable
regions for primer design over a broad range of
species. However, the ApMAT intergenic segment is
flanked by fairly conserved regions for which primers
can be designed, making it an ideal marker for the
C. gloeosporioides complex. To a lesser extent, both
the introns from MAT1-2-1 gene and the two Apn2
gene extremities were variable and should also prove
useful for systematic purposes, as reported in other
Colletotrichum studies (Du et al. 2005, Crouch et al.
2006, 2009a; Rojas et al. 2010). Nevertheless, these
markers are not barcode candidates, and attempts to
use them outside the range of the C. gloeosporioides
complex probably will fail due to their highly variable
nature even in priming sites. For example, the
markers developed by Crouch et al. (2009a) to
amplify partial fragments of the Apn2 gene and
intergenic region in the same locus for the graminicolous
Colletotrichum species could not be used in the
isolates analyzed in this study (data not shown). In
fact, after obtaining the homologous sequences from
isolates of the C. gloeosporioides complex alignments
revealed a high divergence between the two groups of
species. However, these markers are much more
suitable than barcode genes to accurately dissect
and unravel the diversity and evolutionary relationships
in a complex of closely related species.
Moreover, as Cai et al. (2009) stated, the selection
and decision of the most suitable barcode gene(s) can
be made only in the process of species delimitation
because only then we know which taxa need to be
distinguished. In other words, we first need to fully
resolve the C. gloeosporioides complex with a set of
highly informative genes to adequately search and
select a barcode gene.","Regarding their informative potential, all newly developed primer pairs generated sequences that were superior to ITS and the two commonly used gene fragments, b-tub2 and GS, which had previously been useful and regarded as fairly informative.

519,"However, gene trees are only single realizations of
the true species tree and they may not reflect the
actual pattern of lineage splitting and divergence due
to coalescent stochasticity (Degnan and Rosenberg
2009, Carstens and Dewey 2010). Therefore, it is
useful to reconstruct individual gene trees to provide
an overview of how each marker depicts species
relationships. In this way, several incongruities were
revealed by comparing the topology of each gene
tree. For example, two isolates that were consistently
shown to cluster with the C. siamense group (Mal5
and CCM5) were monophyletic with isolates from the
C. fructicola group in the GS gene tree. Moreover,
each analyzed locus provided with strong support a
discordant species branching order with each other
and the correct relationship of the studied Colletotrichum
species was not clear. In fact only one gene
tree (b-tub2) was congruent with the current taxonomic
understanding of the sampled species whereas
the ApMAT and MAT1-2-1 gene trees revealed a
significantly deviated phylogenetic signal. Even when
different combinations of genes are concatenated

by the ambiguous relationship of C. siamense, C.
fructicola and C. asianum between the traditional and

discordance between gene trees in phylogenetic
studies, including horizontal gene transfer (Andersson
2005), hybridization (Meng and Kubatko
2009) or incomplete lineage sorting (Degnan and
Rosenberg 2009). To our knowledge this is the first
report of gene-tree discordance among species of the

520,"In this study, even though the total concatenated
dataset provided a single resolved topology congruent
with that of the combined Apn-MAT and individual
ApMAT datasets, the concatenation method assumption
of no heterogeneity between the embedded gene
trees was violated. In addition, the longer and more
informative markers, such as those from the Apn2/
MAT locus, may bias tree topology toward themselves
simply because their phylogenetic signal overwhelms
the information contained in less informative markers
(Knowles and Carstens 2007). Because the evolutionary
history of species is widely considered to be mostly
a stochastic process (Kingman 1982) we have applied
a recent statistical framework that accounts for the
discrepancies of gene trees from multiple unlinked
loci and is specifically conceived to estimate the
species tree. Using a Bayesian hierarchical model, the
BEST program is able not only to accommodate gene
trees heterogeneity but also to retrieve useful information
from it and provide a more accurate estimate
of the true species tree (Edwards et al. 2007). The
resultant species-tree topology supported that of the
total concatenated dataset, except for the C. siamense
and C. asianum relationships. Although all other
nodes were highly supported, there was little support
for the reciprocal monophyly between C. siamense
and C. asianum and the relationship of these two
species plus C. fructicola was unresolved. This result
was obtained in spite of using the large and highly
informative sequence data of our analysis. Nonetheless,
it is expected that the problems and difficulties
derived from incomplete lineage sorting increase as
the time since species divergence decreases (Degnan
and Rosenberg 2009). Thus it seems likely that these
species diverged recently and consequently their
relationships may still not be easily resolved. Nonetheless,
to further understand the processes that
promote speciation and the evolution of phenotypic
traits it will be essential to recognize and delimit
nascent evolutionary lineages (Wiens 2007). In
addition, it will be interesting to assess the effects of
using different outgroup taxa in the phylogenetic
inference as the current taxonomic knowledge of
Colletotrichum increases and molecular tools improve.","In this study, the total concatenated dataset provided a single resolved topology congruent with that of the combined Apn-MAT and individual ApMAT datasets; however, the assumption of no heterogeneity between the embedded gene trees was violated.

408 MYCOLOGIA"," Hindorf (1970) studied Colletotrichum species isolated from Coffea arabica in Kenya. Hyde et al. (2009) discussed the current names of Colletotrichum, while also addressing the confusion surrounding the genus in another work. Johnston and Jones (1997) examined relationships among Colletotrichum isolates from fruit-rots using rDNA sequences. Katoh et al. (2009) provided methods for multiple DNA sequence alignment, and Kingman (1982) introduced the coalescent theory. Knowles and Carstens (2007) focused on delimiting species without relying on monophyletic gene trees, and Kronstad and Staben (1997) discussed mating types in filamentous fungi. Liu (2008) developed BEST for Bayesian estimation of species trees. Lopez-Giraldez and Townsend (2011) created PhyDesign for profiling phylogenetic informativeness, while Lubbe et al. (2004) characterized Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and related species associated with plant diseases. Marshall (2004) presented PerlPrimer for graphical primer design, and Meng and Kubatko (2009) modeled hybrid speciation detection amidst incomplete lineage sorting. Mills et al. (1992) used PCR for differentiation of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides isolates. Munaut et al. (1998) investigated genetic relationships among isolates from Stylosanthes in Africa and Australia. Nguyen et al. (2009) identified Colletotrichum species associated with anthracnose in coffee. Nylander (2004) distributed MrModeltest, and O'Donnell and Cigelnik (1997) studied intragenomic rDNA ITS2 types in Fusarium. Phoulivong et al. (2010) noted that Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is not a common tropical fruit pathogen. Pina-Martins and Paulo (2008) created Concatenator for sequence data matrices. Polashock et al. (2009) provided an overview of the cranberry fruit rot fungal community. Posada and Crandall (1998) developed Modeltest for testing DNA substitution models, and Prihastuti et al. (2009) characterized Colletotrichum species in Thailand. Ramos et al. (2006) molecularly and morphologically characterized Colletotrichum species in citrus anthracnose. Rodr穩guez-Guerra et al. (2005) observed heterothallic mating in Mexican isolates of Glomerella lindemuthiana, while Rojas et al. (2010) distinguished host-associated pathogens from asymptomatic endophytes using multilocus phylogenies in Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Lastly, Ronquist and Huelsenbeck (2003) advanced Bayesian phylogenetic inference with MrBayes.",What types of molecular methods are employed in the studies mentioned for differentiating Colletotrichum species?,How do the relationships among Colletotrichum isolates contribute to our understanding of fungal diversity?,What geographical regions are represented in the studies of Colletotrichum associated with coffee and other plants?,Are there multiple species of Colletotrichum associated with Coffea arabica in Kenya?,Is rDNA sequencing used in the studies referenced in the passage?,Does the passage discuss phylogenetic analysis as a method for understanding fungal relationships?,Application of the Apn2MAT locus to improve the systematics of the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex.pdf

of inoculations on papaw examined with reference to Ridgway's ""Colour Standards
and Nomenclature"" referred the spores of C. gloeosporioides var. minor to bitter
sweet pink and those of C. acutatum to capucine orange.","Colletotrichum acutatum
 C. acutatum is a relatively slow-growing species. The aerial mycelium is moderately dense and fairly well elevated, with a finely tufted surface. The advancing margin is usually abrupt. Initially, the color is white, but after a few days, a greyish aggregated overlay develops from the center, resulting in a final color of grey or greyish brown. This overlay can sometimes have a crystalline appearance. From below, the substrate is white or cream, with occasional creamy pink diffusion. If darker patches are present, they are usually irregular. Recently, a series of isolates obtained from papaw exhibited a bright pink culture. Other characteristics, apart from color, were normal.
 The production of conidia in this species is characteristically abundant, distributed throughout the mycelium, although massed conidiophores resembling acervuli may occur. Superficial spore masses, seen in C. gloeosporioides var. minor, are encountered less frequently. Sometimes, salmon-colored spore masses can be observed through the medium from below, although they are not obvious from above.

Growth is characteristically slow (Table 5) . When first isolated aerial

almost powdery. Typically the colour is pinkish, usually becoming grey to dark
grey in the centre with a pinkish margin which may have a submerged edge. From
below, the substratum is dark in the centre with a fairly broad cream or pinkish
margin. With subculturing, the pink colour tends to become lost and the aerial

587,"Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China as late as 1990 (Hu 1990). Shao (1992) reported strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai for the first time and identified the pathogen as C. acutatum (Dai et al. 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) contributed to these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn C. theobromicola) as the causal agents based on morphological characters. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose of strawberry in China. Crown rot is the most severe disease problem in most strawberry producing areas in China (Ren et al. 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% of yield losses in strawberry fields has been recorded (Xie et al. 2010). The yield of greenhouse cultivated strawberries was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot in Donggang city in Laoning Province in 2009 (Wang 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in green houses of Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al. 2012). However, the majority of studies conducted in China regarding this disease were mainly based on morphology and single gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al. 2006, Ren et al. 2008, 2011). Due to the overlapping characters, species delimitation based on morphology alone is difficult in this genus. Use of multi-gene analysis combined with morphology can provide a better resolution (Cai et al. 2009, Hyde et al. 2014).

Consensus sequences from the sequences generated from forward and reverse primers were obtained using DNAStar v.5.1 and SeqMan v.5.00 (Burland 2000). A combined dataset of the five gene regions was prepared using Clustal X1.81 (Thompson et al. 1997). Further alignment of sequences was achieved using default settings in MAFFT v.7 (Katoh & Toh 2008, http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/) and manual adjustment was conducted using BioEditv.7.0.9.0 (Hall 1999) where necessary. Two separate phylogenetic trees were constructed for the acutatum species complex and for the gloeosporioides species complex. Maximum Parsimony analysis (MP) was performed using PAUP v. 4.0b10 (Swofford 2002) to obtain the most parsimonious trees. Gaps were treated as missing data and ambiguously aligned regions were excluded. Trees were inferred using the heuristic search option with Tree Bisection Reconnection (TBR) branch swapping and 1000 random sequence additions. Maxtrees were set up to 5,000, branches of zero length were collapsed and all multiple parsimonious trees were saved. Descriptive tree statistics for parsimony (Tree Length [TL], Consistency Index [CI], Retention Index [RI], Rescaled Consistency index [RC], and Homoplasy index [HI]) were calculated for trees generated under different optimality criteria. The robustness of the most parsimonious trees was evaluated by 1000 bootstrap replications resulting from maximum parsimony analysis (Hillis & Bull 1993). Kishino-Hasegawa tests (KHT) (Kishino & Hasegawa 1989) were performed in order to determine whether trees were significantly different.","Phylogenetic Analysis

613,"Discussion
Previous studies on Colletotrichum species causing strawberry anthracnose were mainly based on morphological characters and single gene based identifications, which would have been identified to species complexes rather than individual species (Ye et al. 2009). Due to the high variability in morphological characters (Sutton1992, Johnston & Jones 1997), differentiation between two main strawberry pathogens, C. gloeosporioides and C. theobromicola (fragariae) became problematic (Ye et al. 1997, Xie et al. 2010), which led to the use of molecular methods (Cai et al. 2009) as they provide useful data in clarifying the systematics of Colletotrichum (Hyde et al. 2014, Yan et al. 2015). Xie et al. (2010) identified the Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose disease of Strawberry cv. Toyonoka in Zhejiang and Shanghai, China to be C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides and C. theobromicola using morphology and ITS gene region alone. As ITS gene alone does not resolve Colletotrichum species well (Martinez-Culebras 2002, Jelev et al. 2008, Xie et al. 2010), multigene analysis has been adopted to resolve Colletotrichum species satisfactorily (Cai et al. 2009, Hyde et al. 2014), and the present study has followed this protocol.","Discussion
 Previous studies on Colletotrichum species causing strawberry anthracnose primarily relied on morphological characteristics and single-gene identifications, often categorizing them into species complexes rather than identifying individual species. Due to the high variability in morphological traits, distinguishing between the two main strawberry pathogens, C. gloeosporioides and C. theobromicola (fragariae), has proven challenging. This difficulty led to the adoption of molecular methods, which provide valuable data for clarifying the systematics of Colletotrichum. Xie et al. identified the Colletotrichum species responsible for anthracnose in Strawberry cv. Toyonoka in Zhejiang and Shanghai, China, as C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. theobromicola using morphology and the ITS gene region alone. However, the ITS gene alone does not effectively resolve Colletotrichum species, prompting the use of multigene analysis to satisfactorily distinguish these species, a protocol followed in the present study.",What challenges did previous studies face in identifying Colletotrichum species affecting strawberries?,How has the introduction of molecular methods improved the identification of Colletotrichum species?,Which specific Colletotrichum species were identified as causing anthracnose in the Strawberry cv.

616,"In this study, we have determined the species of Colletotrichum that are associated with strawberry anthracnose in eight strawberry growing provinces of China. A new Colletotrichum species that causes strawberry anthracnose in China is described as C. changpingense, based on morphological features, multi-gene phylogenetic analysis and pathogenicity assays. The five gene multi-loci analysis revealed that this isolate from rhizomes, clustered separately from other Colletotrichum species. Pathogenicity testing showed that the newly introduced species is pathogenic not only on the strawberry crowns, but also on fruits and leaves. This species is capable of causing crown rot disease which is characterized by reddish brown rhizomes with less roots and wilted leaves. Anthracnose lesions on ripe strawberry fruits are firm, slightly sunken and covered with pink masses. This species is also capable of causing leaf spots on strawberry characterized by brown to black necrotic spots along the veins and inter-vein regions. Fifteen strains of C. fructicola were recorded from a fruit, petioles, rhizomes and a stolon and five strains of C. nymphaeae were also recorded from fruits, petioles and a stolon. As the latter two species are well-known pathogens causing strawberry anthracnose in different countries (Damm et al. 2012, Weir et al. 2012), this paper further contributes that these two species are also associated with strawberry anthracnose in China. In this study we did not find C. theobromicola. However, there were 15 more isolates in the single phylogenetic tree which consisted of all the Colletotrichum species that were not well-resolved. Further clarifications of those isolates are needed. This study contributes in updating the Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry of China. Species with similar morphology may have a considerable physiological and pathogenic variation. It is important to know the host distribution of a particular Colletotrichum species which will be important in implementing bio-security measures in quarantine (Jayawardena et al. 2016).","In this study, we determined the species of Colletotrichum associated with strawberry anthracnose in eight strawberry-growing provinces of China.
